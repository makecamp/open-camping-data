    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cold Springs Peak Cabin is a primitive log cabin that was originally constructed in 1931 to shelter firefighters and other work crews. It was last used for firefighters in 1953.<br /><br /> In 1989, Forest Service employees shored up the cabins foundation, re-shingled the roof and installed a stove.
