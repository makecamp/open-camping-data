    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Barber Flat Cabin site was established for administrative use by the Forest Service in 1923, and was used prior to that by the Barber Lumber Company. At the time, the Forest Service used a cabin already on-site as a guard station and then built a new one in 1927. The current cabin and outbuildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935, and the cabin today looks much as it did back then.<br /><br />Guests can drive to Barber Flat Cabin in two-wheel drive passenger cars or trucks, although the roads may occasionally be rough. The cabin provides most of the conveniences needed for a comfortable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Barber Flat Cabin is situated near the North Fork Boise River among towering Ponderosa pines at an elevation of about 4,300 feet. The cabin is surrounded by the Boise Mountains and tucked beneath Hungarian Ridge.<br /><br />Osprey nests are a common sight around Barber Flat. Visitors to this area may see other wildlife, such as mule deer, Rocky Mountain elk, chukars, wild turkeys, eagles and the occasional black bear or wolf.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Several multi-use trails run east and west from the cabin. Hikers and mountain bikers can access the Barber Flat Trailhead nearby, and the Hungarian/Sunset Trail is located just across the road about 200 yards north of the cabin. Other trails in the area include the Beaver Creek/Grand Mountain Trail and the Short Creek Trail, which is known as a haven for nesting ospreys.<br /><br />The river offers great rainbow trout fishing and many swimming holes. Seasonal big game hunting is another popular pastime in the surrounding area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can sleep six people on two bunkbeds and a futon, and mattresses are provided. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, cookware, dishes, utensils, a propane stove, refrigerator and sink with hot water. The bathroom has a sink, bathtub and flush toilet.<br /><br />A wood stove is provided for heat and firewood may be gathered from the surrounding forest. A picnic table and campfire ring with benches are located outside. Trash and recycle bins are behind the cabin.<br /><br />The cabin has no electricity. Bedding, pillows and towels are not provided. Guests should use the broom and dustpan provided to tidy up the cabin before leaving.",
