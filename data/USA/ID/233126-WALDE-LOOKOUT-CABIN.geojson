    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Walde Lookout Cabin was built in 1941 to house the employees who worked in the adjacent fire lookout, which was built in 1939. The fire lookout is still in use duringthe summer and fall, so the cabin is only available for rent from approximately mid-December through late March. This charming, rustic cabin has been restored to itsoriginal character.<br /><br />Guests must reach the cabin by snowmobile, skis or snowshoes. This is a trip of around 17 miles, and guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety. The cabin provides a few conveniences, but guests will need to bring some supplies and gear to make a cozy and comfortable retreat for enjoying winter recreation.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at an elevation of 5,220 feet on the watershed divide between the Lochsa and Clearwater Rivers. This vantage point shows off the western slopes of the vast Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the jagged peaks of the Selway Crags. The cabin is surrounded by a dense evergreen forest.<br /><br />The winter landscape is blanketed in deep, pristine snow. Wildlife sightings may include mule and white-tailed deer, elk, moose, gray wolf and cougar. A variety of birds also inhabit the area. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Several trails crisscross the vicinity, ideal for snowmobiling, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing. There are good places to sled nearby. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This 14x16-ft. log cabin accommodates four people with two mattresses located in a loft area and two cots. A wood stove heats the cabin, which is also equipped with a table and four chairs, a propane cook stove, propane lights, basic cooking and eating utensils, smoke alarm, mop and bucket, fire extinguisher and a snow shovel. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/clearwater/VisitorInfo/Assets/pdfs/walde.pdf>Click here</a> for additional cabin details.<br /><br /> Firewood is available in a shed just outside.
