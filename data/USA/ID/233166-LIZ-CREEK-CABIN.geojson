    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Liz Creek Cabin was built in 1929 as a single-room cabin with a front porch. This is a good example of a common type of backcountry guard station built for Forest Service workers at that time. Its now eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br /> Guests must hike or mountain bike to reach the cabin via the Weitas Creek Trail or the Liz Butte Trail. Weitas Creek can accommodate off-road vehicles for the first7.8 miles; the last 1.5 miles must be completed on foot. Liz Butte requires 3 miles of travel on foot or mountain bike.<br /><br />   Only a few amenities are provided, so guests will need to bring most of their own supplies and gear. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Liz Creek Cabin is situated at the confluence of Liz and Weitas Creeks at an elevation of approximately 3,500 feet. It sits in a meadow that fills with colorful wildflowers every summer. Beyond the meadow is evergreen forest and the peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains.<br /><br />Elk, white-tailed and mule deer, black bear, cougar, mountain goat and moose call this area home. They mostly roam at night but can occasionally be seen in the daytime. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Trails 20 (Weitas Creek) and 649 (Liz Butte) are the access trails used to reach the cabin. The Weitas Creek Trail is 29.2 miles and connects Weitas Campground (Road 250) with 12 Mile Saddle (Road 500). The Liz Butte Trail is 4.2 miles and connects Liz Butte with the mouth of Liz Creek. Liz Butte Trail is closed to motorized traffic, though off-road vehicles can access a part of Weitas Creek Trail.<br /><br />Both creeks offer fishing opportunities.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Liz Creek Cabin accommodates a maximum of four people. It has a sleeping loft with two army cots. A wood-burning stove provides heat. Other amenities include a table with chairs, broom and dustpan, storage cabinets and a fire extinguisher. A campfire ring and outhouse with pit toilet are located outside the cabin.<br /><br />No water, firewood or electricity is provided. Guests need to bring their own water supply or treat water from the creek. They are expected to pack out trash and tidy up the cabin before leaving.<br /><br />Items such as fire starters (matches and newspaper), a cook stove, flashlights or lanterns, bedding, pillows, cookware, dishes, utensils, garbage bags and toilet paper are not provided. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Lolo Motorway stretches 100 miles through scenic mountain landscapes. Summer visitors can see meadows and hillsides blanketed in colorful wildflowers. Travelers should be prepared for rough, sometimes treacherous conditions. No services are located along this road, so travelers should have plenty of gas, food and water for the drive.",
