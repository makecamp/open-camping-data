    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Malad Summit Guard Station is located 14 miles north of Malad, Idaho on Malad Pass just off I-15. The rustic one-room cabin is in a forested setting in narrow Mill Creek Drainage, and offers a secluded retreat on fenced acreage surrounded by scenic high country views. <br /><br />The original guard station was established in 1908, but was replaced by the existing cabin in 1934. The cabin is accessible by car when there is no snow. Guests should be prepared in snowy conditions to ski, snowshoe or snowmobile half a mile from the plowed road to reach the cabin. The guard station offers many amenities for a comfortable stay, but fewer conveniences are available in winter. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The rustic single-room cabin is tucked into a forest of deciduous and conifers at an elevation of about 6,000 feet. Mill Creek meanders through the site.<br /><br /> The front porch invites guests to sit and enjoy views of the forest and possible wildlife sightings. Black bears, wolves, elk, moose, mule deer, bison, grizzly bears, mountain lions and pronghorn are some of the species native to the area (<a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/wildlifeAlert.html>bearsafety tips</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>The surrounding area offers a variety of recreational activities. Trails are provided for hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders and off-road vehicles (<a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm>Idaho OHV safety message</a>).<br /><br />Anglers can fish for small brook trout in Mill Creek. Hunting for game and game birds is another popular pastime. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Cabin amenities include a wood stove, table and chairs, two bunkbeds with mattresses, two folding cots, a broom and dustpan, sink and propane appliances (space heater, water heater, stove/oven, large fridge). Guests may find limited dishes and cookware. The mudroom is equipped with shower facilities. <br /><br />A vault toilet outhouse, campfire ring and picnic table are outside. Corrals are available for stock. Parking is available for three RVs. Wood is seasonally available and stacked next to the cabin. <br /><br /> The cabins water supply is shut off during the winter months to prevent freezing. Winter guests need to bring their own water. Bedding, cleaning supplies, towels, garbage bags, first aid supplies, matches and lanterns or flashlights are not provided.
