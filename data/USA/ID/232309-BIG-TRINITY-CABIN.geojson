    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Big Trinity Cabin and adjacent Little Trinity Cabin offer a quiet retreat in a beautiful high alpine landscape. The cabins are situated within a popular summer recreation area with many activities to enjoy.<br /><br />The cabins have a limited season due to late snow melt, but they are accessible by car. Many creature comforts are provided. However, guests may want to bring some supplies and gear to make their experience more comfortable and enjoyable.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabins are located in a dense lodgepole pine forest close to the East Fork Roaring River at an elevation of 7,900 feet. Theyre nestled among four subalpine lakes: Big Roaring River Lake, Little Roaring River Lake, Big Trinity Lake and Little Trinity Lake. The peaks of the Boise Mountains surround the cabins, and Trinity Mountain, the tallest in the range at 9,700 feet, is just to the south.<br /><br />Snow can make this area inaccessible until early July, but soon afterward, the land is blanketed by colorful summer wildflowers. This area is a haven for elk and deer, but wildlife watchers may also spot an occasional black bear.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers can access the 4-mile Rainbow Basin Trail System from Big Trinity Lake. The William H. Pogue National Recreation Trail and Lava Mountain Trail are for off-road vehicle enthusiasts, mountain bikers, hikers and horseback riders. Both of these trails can be accessed near Big Roaring River Lake. The Little Roaring River Trail at Little Roaring River Lake is also open to mountain bike, off-road vehicles and hiking. <a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm>Click here </a> for an Idaho OHV Safety Message.<br /><br />Anglers can fish in any of the nearby lakes for rainbow and cutthroat trout. The lakes are also ideal for exploring by canoe or kayak.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The larger cabin sleeps six and is equipped with one double bed, a sofa bed, side tables, a drop-down kitchen table, cleaning supplies, dishes and tableware, chairs and a dining table, cookware and a fire extinguisher. A wood stove is available for heating and cooking. The smaller cabin sleeps four, and has the same amenities.<br /><br />A picnic table and campfire ring with grill are provided outside. Drinking water is available from a nearby hand pump. A shed located behind the cabin is stocked with seasoned wood, a splitting maul, axe and hatchet. An outhouse with vault toilet is located outside.<br /><br />No electricity or propane is available. Guests must bring garbage bags to pack out their trash. Bedding, lighting and emergency supplies are not provided. Guests are responsible for cleaning the cabin before leaving.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The summit of Trinity Mountain is the highest drivable point in Idaho, although the road may be blocked by snow until early July. A short, steep hike takes visitors to the lookout tower for panoramic views of several subalpine lakes and other mountains in the Boise Range.",
