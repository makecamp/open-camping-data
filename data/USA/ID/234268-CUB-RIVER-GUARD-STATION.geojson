    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cub River Guard Station was established in 1907, and the first cabin was built in 1909 about a mile from the current site. This cabin was short-lived, and a second structure was built in 1922 and used until 1934. A third structure occupied this area after that until it burned down in 1957. The current cabin was built 2 years later.<br /><br />The cabin is open year-round and can be accessed by car in warmer months. Guests must snowmobile to the cabin on groomed trails in the winter. Many modern conveniences are provided at the guard station, but some are seasonal and not guaranteed, so guests should be prepared to bring much of their own equipment and supplies.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Cub River Guard Station is situated near the banks of the Cub River at an elevation of 6,000 feet. The grounds are partially shaded by mixed hardwood, pine and cottonwood trees.<br /><br />Wildflowers dot the landscape in warmer months. Dense thickets of willow around Cub River attract local moose, but elk and deer are also seen in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Numerous hiking, biking, horse and off-road vehicle trails crisscross the area, offering great opportunities to get out and explore. The area becomes a playground for snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months. Nearby trailheads lead to several multi-use trails, including the Highline National Recreation Trail. <a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm target=_blank>Click here</a> for an Idaho OHV safety message. <br /><br />Anglers can fly-fish for cutthroat and rainbow trout in the Cub River.
