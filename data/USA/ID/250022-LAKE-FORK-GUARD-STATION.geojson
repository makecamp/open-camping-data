    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Lake Fork Guard Station is located within the Lick Creek Corridor just over seven miles from the town of McCall, Idaho.  Originally constructed in early 1933 by workers in the CCC, this cabin was remodeled by the Payette National Forest in 2011, updating the interior and bringing the building into accordance with the American Disabilities Act. <h4>Natural Features:</h4><b>This cabin sits at an approximate elevation of 5,300 feet and is situated within a dense conifer forest on the Lick Creek Road just outside of the town of McCall, Idaho.  The Payette National Forest contains some of Idahos most beautiful and diverse country.  Located in west-central Idaho, north of Boise, the 2.2 million-acre forest extends 100 miles west to east, from Hells Canyon to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, and 70 miles north to south, from the Salmon River to the Weiser River.</b><h4>Recreation:</h4>Located on the North Fork of Lake Creek this site offers access to mountain bike trails and hiking trails as well as trails easily traversed by horseback.  Your day could take you to one (or more) of the numerous alpine lakes for fishing or swimming.  Peaks and summits nearing the 8,400 foot elevation are within easy riding or walking distance on a day trip.  Visitors interested in kayaking will enjoy the North Fork of Lake Creek downstream to the Little Payette Lake for smallmouth bass or Tiger Muskie fishing. After any of these adventures you can return to the cabin for a well-earned nights rest.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The guard station has flush toilets and potable water. Propane lights, a heating system and new kitchen appliances bring comfort to your time in this great location.<br />There is adequate room within this site for up to two medium sized tents for additional sleeping accommodations.  Parking is available for one, four-horse stock trailer if you bring your horses (up to four head of pack and saddle stock are allowed).  <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>If your interests include rock climbing, Slick Rock is within a few miles of the cabin.  Slick Rock is one of the largest granitic bodies of rock within the United States, offering some of the longest continuous technical rock climbing in Idaho.  Slick Rock routes range from eight to ten pitches and vary in difficulty.  Not a climber?  Take the scenic Lick Creek Road to explore the South Fork of the Salmon River drainage, or continue on into the historic towns of Yellow Pine and Stibnite.  If you are visiting the first full weekend of August, enjoy the Yellow Pine Harmonica Festival!",
