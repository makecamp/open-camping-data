    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Glade Creek Campground is a group site.  The campground is located along US Highway 12 on the Clearwater National Forest about 7 miles east of Lowell, Idaho.  Located in the mountains of north central Idaho, the forested site offers  campers river access and beautiful scenery.  The site is suitable for groups up to 35 people and is perfect for families and groups who want easy access to the Lochsa River.  Fees are $50 per night.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is situated between US highway 12 and the Lochsa River.  The campground is on a large bend in the river, which makes the beach completely hidden from the highway. With shade from the surrounding stand of mixed-age conifers and low-growing shrubs, it&rsquo;s a cool reprieve during the summer.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Popular activities include fishing and swimming.  For the whitewater thrill-seekers, the Wild and Scenic Lochsa River holds exciting floating and kayaking opportunities. There are three hiking/biking trails within two miles of the campground; #142, #111 and #107.  These trails are also open to motorcycles from approximately June through September.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Glade Creek has four campsites and encompasses about one acre.   Two of the sites are located adjacent to the river.  There is a group fire ring with benches also adjacent to the river.  All four sites have accessible fire rings, ten foot picnic tables, level tent pads and graveled parking areas.  Site 2 has an extra table and several tent sites.  The spurs are short and not suitable for RVs greater than 24 feet.  The campground has one vault toilet.  There is no water system or dumpster at this site. Campers may use the water and dumpster at Apgar campground, one mile west on Highway 12.  There are no power, water or sewer hook-ups at any of the sites.",
