    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cape Horn Winter Rental is located in beautiful Elk Meadow, approximately 16 miles northwest of Stanley, in central Idaho. It sits at an elevation of 6,660 feet. Guests enjoy the area for its endless winter recreation opportunities, including cross-country skiing, back country downhill skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated in a stand of lodgepole pines. On clear days, the cabins front porch affords breathtaking views of the rugged Sawtooth Mountain Range to the south. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The Cape Horn area offers unlimited cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling opportunities in the surrounding meadows, and downhill skiing is available on the slopes behind the cabin. <a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm>Click here</a> for an Idaho OHV safety message.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is open for reservations during the winter only. In the summer, it is used by Forest Service employees as a guard station. <br /><br />The cabin can comfortably accommodate five people on one double bed and one single bed, each with mattresses, and two couches. More people can use sleeping bags on the floor, but due to the cabins size, it is strongly recommended that groups be limited to eight people, though the absolute maximum allowed is 10. <br /><br />The cabin is equipped with electricity, which powers the lights and a standard four-burner stove and oven, but due to heavy snowfall on power lines, electricity cannot be guaranteed at all times. Be prepared to cook meals on the wood stove if the power is out. Firewood is provided, though it may need to be split. <br /><br />A table and chairs and additional seating is provided, along with candles, an oil lamp and a wooden rack for drying clothes. The water system is turned off during the winter season so the indoor flush toilet and running water are not available. A vault toilet is located behind the station.",
