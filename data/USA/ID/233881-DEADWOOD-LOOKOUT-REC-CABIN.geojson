    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Deadwood Lookout Recreation Cabin is a historic former Forest Service fire lookout on Deadwood Mountain. The structure provides sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding forest, making this a unique place to overnight.<br /><br />At least two other lookouts have existed previously on Deadwood Mountain, but the current one was built in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It was actively used as a fire lookout until 1972. It has since become one of the most popular rental cabins in Idaho.<br /><br />The peak season is late June through mid-October. Guests can drive to the cabin, but high clearance vehicles are recommended for the dirt access road because it is narrow, steep and winding.<br /><br />The cabin offers only a few basic amenities. Guests should be prepared to bring most of what they need to make themselves comfortable, but the views of the mountains by day and the stars at night guarantee a memorable and rewarding experience.<br /><p><iframe width=385 height=242 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/DOvu84Y8WSc?feature=player_embedded scrolling=no frameborder=0  style=border: 0px none transparent;> </iframe> </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is perched atop Deadwood Mountain at an elevation of 8,200 feet. A variety of colorful wildflowers bloom around the base of the cabin in the summer, and stands of conifers dot the landscape.<br /><br />Mornings bring unobstructed views of sunrises. Guests can watch the sun set each evening and then gaze out at an endless canopy of stars.<br /><br />Wildlife enthusiasts may spot elk, deer and bear in the surrounding area. Bull moose have occasionally been spotted along nearby trails. Guests may find swallows and other birds nesting just outside the lookout.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers and mountain bikers have access to three nearby trails: Scott Mountain, Julie Creek and Nellies Basin. The Deadwood Ridge Trail is a popular destination for equestrians, hikers, mountain bikers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. <a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm>Click here </a> for an Idaho OHV Safety Message.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This rustic cabin is a 14x14-ft. room equipped with two single beds with mattresses that can be fastened together.
