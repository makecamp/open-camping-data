    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Adams Ranger Station Cabin is located in the heart of the Nez Perce National Forest at an elevation of 5,150 feet. Adams Camp served as a way station along the Milner Trail as early as 1862. The Forest Service established the area adjacent to Adams Camp as an administrative site in 1919. Adams Ranger Station was built in 1932 for the District Ranger and his family. It last served as District headquarters in 1958. Since then, it has served as a work center, hosting a variety of summer crews.<br /><br /> The historic cabin is available for rent year-round, except during spring melt, which typically occurs from mid-March to late May. Winter access is approximately 30 miles from Fish Creek Snow Park along a groomed snowmobile route.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Adams Ranger Station is near the Gospel-Hump Wilderness and part of the Salmon River/Highway 95 Corridor. The landscape in this corridor varies from the emerald Salmon River pouring through steep canyon walls to sapphire Moores Lake in the remote Gospel-Hump Wilderness.<br /><br />The Gospel-Hump Wilderness has elevations ranging from 1,970 feet at the Wind River pack bridge on the Salmon River to 8,940 feet at the summit of Buffalo Hump. The northern part of the Wilderness is wetter and heavily forested; the southern part is dry and sparsely vegetated. The two parts are separated by a rugged, glaciated divide which contains the peaks for which the wilderness is named.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area includes mountain lions, moose, bighorn sheep, mountain goats and wolves.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Many fun activities surround Adams Ranger Station, including numerous trails. Corral Creek, a nearby stock facility and trailhead, can accommodate horsesand hikers. This trail system leads into the beautiful Gospel-Hump Wilderness.<br /><br /> The Milner Trail, Road #641, is open to off-road vehicles in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can accommodate up to eight people and has one futon, one double bed, two single beds and two cots. Some blankets and pillows are provided. There is a vault toilet, a propane cook stove/oven, dishes, silverware, cookware, bakeware, a table and chairs. Other amenities include propane lanterns, a broom, bucket, mop, snow shovels, axes, mauls and firewood rounds.<br /><br />  Water is not available on-site. Guests must bring their own or melt snow in the winter. It is recommended that visitors bring flashlights, extra batteries, matches, lighters, garbage bags, candles, lantern mantles, newspapers for lighting fires, warm clothes, rain gear, boots, white gas and small propane canisters, first aid kit, cabin shoes or slippers, maps of Nez Perce National Forest and the Gospel Hump Wilderness and lock combinations.
