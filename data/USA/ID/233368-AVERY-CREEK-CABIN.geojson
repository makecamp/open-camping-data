The fully furnished three-room cabin is adjacent to the North Fork Coeur dAlene River on the Coeur dAlene River Ranger District in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. <br /><br />The cabin was built between 1926 and 1928 to house Forest Service employees needed for administrative supervision and fire protection. It was built from a standard Forest Service plan known as the firemens cabin. In 1935, a picnic area was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps across the road from the cabin and adjacent to the North Fork of the Coeur dAlene River. In 1940, a bathroom was added in a board and batten shed addition to the cabins east side, and a rustic log garage was built behind the cabin. The cabin was used for crew housing until 1981. <br /><br />Newly renovated, the cabin is now fully accessible. Avery Cabins central location along the North Fork Coeur dAlene River provides easy access to the site. Access to the cabin is along paved roadways, making it an easy destination to reach by car.
