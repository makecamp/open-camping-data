    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Beaver Creek Cabin site was established for administrative use in 1912. The current dwelling was built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps using standard blueprints for that time.<br /><br />Beaver Creek Cabin is open year-round. Its accessible by car in the summer months and by snowshoes or cross-country skis in winter. Guests arriving in winter should park at the Whoop-Um-Up Park N Ski Area (permit required) and access the 1.5 mile Pilgrim Trail to reach the cabin. The trail is moderately difficult in normal conditions, and guests are responsible for their own safety.<br /><br />The cabin offers many creature comforts for an enjoyable stay. However, several of the amenities are only available seasonally. Guests should be prepared to bring certain supplies or gear according to the season.<br /><br /><p /><p><iframe width=385 height=242 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/2y_kAB5_U9A?feature=player_embedded scrolling=no frameborder=0 style=border: 0px none transparent;> </iframe> </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>A mixed-growth pine forest surrounds the area, offering pretty scenery and partial shade.
