    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>This site was originally established as Deer Park Ranger Guard Station in 1913, and a cabin was built here in 1917. This cabin, along with many others in Boise National Forest, was replaced in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Deer Park Cabin looks much the same today as it did in the 1930s.<br /><br />The cabin is available from mid-May through late September, and its easily accessible by car in good weather. Many creature comforts are provided, but guests may need to bring additional gear and supplies to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Deer Park Cabin is located in an open meadow lined with mature Ponderosa pines at an approximate elevation of 4,400 feet. Nearby, the North Fork Boise River rushes over rocks and through jagged granite walls studded with pine trees.<br /><br />Wildlife watchers may want to look for deer and elk. Bears are occasional visitors to the area as well. A variety of waterfowl is attracted to the river, as well as bald eagles and osprey.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The North Fork Boise River Trail, which begins directly behind the cabin, leads hikers upstream. The 5-mile trail passes through some of the roughest, most scenic canyon walls in Idaho before dipping down to the rivers edge to pass by a rock bluff.<br /><br />Horse Heaven Trail begins about a mile from the cabin and connects with the Swanholm/Warrior Trails. All these trails are open to hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers, dirt bikers and motorcyclists, although some of the sections of the trail may be particularly difficult for motorcycles. <a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/safety.htm>Click here </a> for an Idaho OHV Safety Message.<br /><br />The river flows across the road from the cabin, offering good rainbow trout fishing after about July 1st. Big game hunting is also a popular pastime in the area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin accommodates six people on a futon and two sets of bunkbeds with mattresses. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, propane stove, refrigerator, cookware, dishes, utensils and a dry sink. A wood stove is provided for heat and firewood can be gathered from the surrounding forest. Garbage collection is provided.<br /><br />A vault toilet outhouse is just outside. A shed to the right of the cabin houses a hand pump for potable water. A picnic table and campfire ring are located out front.<br /><br />The cabin has no indoor plumbing or electricity. Bedding, pillows, lighting and emergency supplies are not provided.",
