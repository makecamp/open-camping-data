    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Liz Butte Cabin is truly a mountain hideaway, situated on top of Liz Butte at 6,098 feet above sea level. This rustic log cabin was built in the 1930s and used as a home for Forest Service lookout guards who spent their days on the tower scanning the horizon for signs of fire. The lookout tower no longer exists.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is via the Lolo Motorway, a primitive, single-lane road constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. It is not recommended for large RVs, vehicles with low ground clearance or trailers.<br /><br /> The cabin is primitive and offers few amenities, so guests should be prepared to bring most of the gear and supplies theyll need for a comfortable stay. The cabin can be accessed by car, but the last half-mile is steep and rocky. High clearance vehicles are recommended. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabins location offers expansive views of the Lochsa River Canyon to the south and the North Fork Canyons of the Clearwater River to the north. Evergreen-forested peaks stretch as far as the eye can see.<br /><br />Guests have an ideal vantage point for watching the sun rise over the mountains each morning and dip below them each night. Wildlife watchers may spot deer, elk, bears, moose, mountain goats and a variety of bird species, including eagles.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers and equestrians can access the Idaho Centennial Trail from the cabin. Other trails lead to Smith Butte or loop around Weitas Ridge. These trails are open tohikers, mountain bikers or horseback riders.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a single room with a sleeping loft and front porch. It accommodates four people and comes equipped with two single beds with mattresses, two cots, a wood stove and a table with chairs.<br /><br /> A stone campfire ring and outhouse with pit toilet is just outside the cabin. Firewood is stacked on the front porch, but it may need to be split.<br /><br />The cabin does not have water or electricity. Guests are responsible for bringing their own drinking water, lighting and garbage bags for packing out trash. A door lock is not provided, so guests may wish to bring their own lock. Items like bedding, a camp stove with fuel, a cooler with ice, first aid supplies, an axe, cookware and utensils, matches and toilet paper are not provided. Guests shouldbring their reservation permit.  <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Lolo Motorway stretches 100 miles through scenic mountain landscapes. Summer visitors can see meadows and hillsides blanketed in colorful wildflowers. Travelers should be prepared for rough, sometimes treacherous conditions. No services are located along this road, so travelers should have plenty of gas, food and water for the drive.",
