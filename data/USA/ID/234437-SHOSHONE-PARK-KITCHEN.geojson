    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Shoshone Park is a pristine forested park with a stream running through the area. It features two reservable kitchen shelters suitable for groups of all types. Perks of the family-friendly site include a baseball field and the Hale Fish Hatchery on the east end of the park.<br /><br />A point of particular interest is the Captain John Mullan historic cabin. Mullan was a 19th Century military commander who built a wagon road, which is used today as a hiking trail and snowmobiling route. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>At 3,600 feet, Shoshone Park sits in a valley at the base of Runt Mountain, a peak in the Bitterroot Mountains. The park is part of Idaho Panhandle National Forests, located near the border of Montana. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Groups enjoy playing baseball on the open field, pitching horseshoes and barbecuing. Bird watching is a rewarding pastime here, and a visit to the fish hatchery always fun.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The park includes 21 first-come first-served picnic tables in addition to the group kitchen facilities. Both kitchen shelters come with large grills and piped drinking water. The West Kitchen Shelter has electric hookups. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>A few miles west is the historic mining town of Mullan, Idaho.",
