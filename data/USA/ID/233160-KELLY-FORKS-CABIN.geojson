    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kelly Forks Cabin is located within the Kelly Forks compound, an active Forest Service Work Center. It is believed to have been built in the mid-1930s, and was originally used as a stopover between the Upper North Fork and the Bungalow Ranger Station.<br /><br />Peak season at the cabin is from mid-June through the end of September. It is accessible by car, but the last 31 miles of the drive are on narrow dirt roads that may be rocky and rutted.<br /><br />The cabin provides many modern comforts, including electricity and indoor plumbing. Guests only need to bring a few of their own amenities to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in a small clearing surrounded by evergreen trees near the beautiful North Fork of the Clearwater River, a free-flowing river where trees and brushgrow on the steep hillsides rising from the waters edge. Kelly Creek, known worldwide as a premium fishery for Westslope cutthroat trout, is just a stones throw from the cabin.<br /><br />Elk, white-tailed and mule deer, black bear, cougar, mountain goat and moose call this area home. They mostly roam at night but can occasionally be seen in the daytime.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Kelly Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, is one of Clearwater National Forests popular fishing streams. Kelly Creek and all of its tributaries are protected by special regulations that allow catch-and-release fishing only. These rules are designed to preserve valued fly-fishing streams.<br /><br />The North Fork of the Clearwater is popular for swimming and tubing. In the summer, guests can pick wild berries that grow in the vicinity. Other recreational activities in the area include hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking. Trail access is less than a mile from the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Maximum occupancy at the Kelly Forks Cabin is six people. The cabin contains one full-size bed with mattress, one twin-size bed with mattress, and two full-size futons. A flush toilet and shower are provided. The kitchen area is equipped with an electric cook stove, microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker and a table with chairs. There is also a centralized propane heater to keep the cabin warm. Cooking pots, pans, dishes, bowls, cups, utensils, a broom and dustpan are provided. A picnic area and fire ring are located just outside. Be sure to bring your own bedding, pillows, dish and bath towels, firewood, and trash bags. There is no garbage service provided on the forest. Visitors must pack out their own trash upon departure.<br /><br />Minimum length of stay at the Kelly Forks Cabin is a single night; maximum length of stay is six consecutive nights.",
