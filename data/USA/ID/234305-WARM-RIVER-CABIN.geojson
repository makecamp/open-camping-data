    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Warm River Cabin is located less than 20 miles from Ashton, Idaho, at at Warm River Springs. An Idaho fish and game hatchery operated here from the 1930s to the 1950s. The cabin was formerly the hatchery managers house. It was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1938.<br /><br />The cabin is open year-round and can be accessed by car in the warmer months. Snowmobiles and cross-country skis are required to access the cabin from approximately early December through mid-May. The trek from the nearest available parking at Bear Gulch Trailhead to the cabin is 6 miles. Guests should be prepared to bring much of their own gear and supplies to make their stay comfortable. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is named after the adjacent Warm River Springs, which is the source of the Warm River. The dwelling sits at an elevation of 6,000 feet in an open, grassy area flanked by a conifer forest. Moose and bears are sometimes seen in this area (<a href=http://www.recreation.gov/marketing.do?goto=/wildlifeAlert.html>bear safety tips</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers, horseback riders and mountain bikers can use the nearby trails.
