    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kalispell Island Group Site is located on the southeast side of Kalispell Island on Priest Lake. The rustic campsite is part of the Three Pines camping area at site #29. The island, reached only by boat, faces the beautiful Selkirk Mountains. <br /><br />A popular activity among visitors is to kayak, canoe, or power boat up a 3.5-mile thoroughfare, which leads to the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. The upper lake - just like Kalispell Island - cannot be access by car, so water is an excellent navigation option.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Kalispell Island is one of seven islands scattered throughout Priest Lake. Kalispell is the largest of these islands, spanning 264 acres, and is shaped like a tooth.<br /><br />Priest Lake, at a 2,400 foot elevation, is one of the top three largest lakes in Idaho. To the north, the lake connects to the Upper Priest Lake, divided by a narrow channel, which can be passed through by boat. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Priest Lake is less than an hour from the Canadian Border, nestled deep below the crest of the Selkirk Mountains. Surrounded by the natural beauty of Northern Idaho and the mile-high mountains, this 25,000-acre lake offers clear, blue waters reaching depths of 300 feet.<br /><br />Fantastic wildlife viewing is available on the 2.5-mile loop trail that encircles Kalispell Island, offering phenomenal lake views and bird watching opportunities. <br /><br />The waters of Priest Lake offer anglers access to record-breaking Mackinaw trout, Dolly Varden, Cutthroat and Kokanee. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This site accommodates groups ranging from 10 to 30 people, for non-electric, primitive tent camping. The campground does offer a self pay station, vault toilets, picnic tables and campfire rings. <br /><br />The site has no drinking water or trash collection, so it is important that campers bring plenty of water and trash bags. Access is only by boat. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Hike the Lakeshore or Beach Trails that traverse along the west shore of Priest Lake. The Beach trail extends between Outlet Bay Campground and the Kalispell Bay Boat Launch. The Lakeshore Trail runs for 8 miles along the northwest shores of Priest Lake. <br /><br />In winter, ice fishing, shoe shoeing and snowmobiling on nearby trails entertain visitors.",
