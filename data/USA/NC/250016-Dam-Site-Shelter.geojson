    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Dam Site Park Shelter is one of W. Kerr Scott Dam&rsquo;s most popular shelters and is located in northwestern North Carolina.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The gentle Yadkin River flows through its scenic namesake valley on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountain foothills. Forests of mixed hardwoods, including sycamore, poplar, oak and hickory, cover the region. Wildlife is abundant in the valley. White-tailed deer, black bear, eastern cottontails and more can be found among the hills. Birds in the area include wild turkey, woodpeckers, Carolina chickadees, red-eyed vireo, ovenbirds, mallards and wood ducks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The 1,475-acre reservoir offers excellent boating, canoeing, kayaking and swimming opportunities. Anglers will find channel catfish, large and smallmouth bass, bluegill, threadfin shad, spotted bass, hybrid striped bass and tiger muskellunge. Miles of hiking trails surround the lake, including the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, which has a trailhead a short walk from the shelter. An additional 25 miles of multi-purpose trails can be found at the Warrior Creek and Dark Mountain areas.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The shelter offers eight, 8-foot picnic tables and two, 10-foot ADA-accessible picnic tables. A water spigot and electric hook-ups are available at the shelter as well.
