    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Fish Dam Creek Shelter is one of W. Kerr Scott Dam&rsquo;s most popular shelters and located in northwestern North Carolina.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The gentle Yadkin River flows through its scenic namesake valley on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountain foothills. Forests of mixed hardwoods, including sycamore, poplar, oak and hickory, cover the region. Wildlife is abundant in the valley. White-tailed deer, black bear, eastern cottontails and more can be found among the hills. Birds in the area include wild turkey, woodpeckers, Carolina chickadees, red-eyed vireo, ovenbirds, mallards and wood ducks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The 1,475-acre reservoir offers excellent boating, canoeing, kayaking and swimming opportunities. Anglers will find channel catfish, large and smallmouth bass, bluegill, threadfin shad, spotted bass, hybrid striped bass and tiger muskellunge. Roughly 30 miles of hiking trails surround the lake, including the short but scenic Fish Dam Creek trail which has a trailhead behind the shelter. Two more trail systems can be found a short walk or drive away accessible from Dark Mountain Park or the VAC parking lot.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The shelter offers eight, 8-foot picnic tables and one, 10-foot ADA-accessible picnic table. A water spigot and electric hook-ups are available at the shelter as well. Along with scenic views, you can enjoy other park amenities which include a playground, horseshoe pit, grill, vault toilets, hiking trails and five mini-shelters (first come-first serve).",
