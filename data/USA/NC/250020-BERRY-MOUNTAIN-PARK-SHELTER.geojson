    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Berry Mountain Park Shelter is located in Berry Mountain Park at W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir in northwestern North Carolina. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The gentle Yadkin River flows through its scenic namesake valley on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountain foothills. Forests of mixed hardwoods, including sycamore, poplar, oak and hickory, cover the region. Wildlife is abundant in the valley. White-tailed deer, black bear, eastern cottontails and more can be found among the hills. Birds in the area include wild turkey, woodpeckers, Carolina chickadees, red-eyed vireo, ovenbirds, mallards and wood ducks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The 1,475-acre reservoir offers excellent boating, canoeing, kayaking and swimming opportunities. Anglers will find channel catfish, large and smallmouth bass, bluegill, threadfin shad, spotted bass, hybrid striped bass and tiger muskellunge. Roughly 30 miles of multi-purpose trails surround the lake, one of which can be accessed from the park. All of these trails are recognized as some of the best mountain biking trails in the country attracting riders from all corners of the world.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This ADA-accessible lakefront shelter offers six, 8-foot picnic tables. A water spigot can be found at the shelter but there is no electricity available. You can enjoy other park amenities which include a playground, grill, flush toilets, showers, swim beach and a basketball court.",
