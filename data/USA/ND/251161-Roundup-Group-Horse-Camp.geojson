    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>For groups with or without horses visiting the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Roundup Horse Campground is a great place to stay. Located 12 miles from the entrance to the South Unit of the park, the campground is open from May 1 &ndash; October 31.  <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Little Missouri River is the central, unifying feature of this wild and broken land where, as a young man, Theodore Roosevelt ranched and hunted in the 1880s.   The park is part of both the Northern Great Plains and the West, blending a rich natural beauty with diverse human history.  The rugged topography, with its flora and fauna, also provides an opportunity to discover the badlands environment as Roosevelt once did.  It is a place to experience a land and way of life that helped shape Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s attitudes and philosophy regarding conservation. Cottonwood trees surrounding the campsite turn golden in the fall.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers and horseback riders can access the estimated 70 miles of trails within a short distance of the campground; please stop at a Visitor Center for more details. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Toilets, drinking water and picnic tables are provided at this facility.
