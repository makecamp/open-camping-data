    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Veterans Lake Pavilion overlooks the north side of Veterans Lake, with a perfect view of colorful sunsets reflected in the lake. Veterans Lake, deemed a no-wake lake, is a ideal campground for water sports  like kayaking, canoeing and fishing. The campsite is easily accessible from nearby towns and is situated close to several hiking trails.<p>Veterans Lake is part of the Platt Historic District in Chickasaw National Recreation Area. The district was named Platt National Park in 1906 and was one of the nations earliest national parks. In 1976, it merged with the Arbuckle National Recreation Area to form what is now Chickasaw.</p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>Chickasaw National Recreation Area is where two ecosystems, the eastern deciduous forest and the mixed-grass prairie of the west, converge. This creates unique geological formations and attracts a wide variety of plant and animal species. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Swim, paddle or fish Veterans Lake, and hike or bike around the lakes loop trail, called Veterans Trail. This is the only paved trail in the park, which makes it stroller and roller blade-friendly.<br /><br />A bison pasture is just up the road, so bring the kids and cameras to see the beautiful animals grazing. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 80-person picnic area has easy access to a boat launch. Theres a grill but no electricity, so be sure to bring charcoal if you plan to have a cookout. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Travertine Nature Center is worth a visit, as is the collection of springs nearby. Pavilion Springs, Black Sulphur Springs and Hillside Springs are the regions remaining natural mineral springs and have historically been used for medicinal and restorative healing.",
