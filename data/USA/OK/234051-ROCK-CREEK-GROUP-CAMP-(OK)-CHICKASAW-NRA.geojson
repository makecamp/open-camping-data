    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Rock Creek Group Camp is the closest campground to Veterans Lake, and is an ideal access point for fishing, hiking, mineral springs and nearby Rock Creek.<br /><br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4>Two ecosystems converge in Chickasaw National Recreation Area: the eastern deciduous forest and the mixed-grass prairie of the west. This creates a unique landscape, attracting a wide variety of plant and animal life. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Swimming opportunities abound, with streams and springs dotting the park landscape. Nearby hiking trails weave along these streams--passing through cool rushing waterfalls--and leading to mineral water and freshwater springs. Wildlife photographers can look out for the red fox, turkey, dear and opossum. <h4>Facilities:</h4>One group site is available at Rock Creek, and its open year-round. These are non-electrical sites that are designed for tent camping, but small RVs can be accommodated.  <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visit the impressive Chickasaw Cultural Center to learn about the Native Americans of the region through exhibits, videos and interactive displays. Or head to the bison pasture to watch the beautiful animals grazing.",
