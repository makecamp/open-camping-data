    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Pine Island Group Area is located along the Bighorn Scenic Byway (U.S. Highway 14) near the Burgess Junction at an elevation of 8,400 feet. The Bighorn National Forest offers a wide variety of activities, including hiking, fishing, scenic driving and a number of historic sites.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is situated on the banks of the South Fork Tongue River in the Bighorn Mountains, where craggy granite peaks rise over 13,000 feet above sea level. A forest of lodgepole pine covers the area, creating excellent wildlife habitat. Englemann spruce and Douglas fir dot the landscape.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Off-road vehicle trails, scenic jeep roads, hiking, fishing and canoeing are available in the surrounding area. Diverse hikes vary from loop trails to treks along creeks and over mountain peaks; many trails access the Cloud Peak Wilderness. <br /><br />Nearby Sibley Lake is open to non-motorized craft and offers an accessible fishing dock on the shoreline. Anglers fish for rainbow, brown and brook trout.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground offers one group site for overnight camping or day-use picnicking. It can accommodate up to 150 people. A three-sided picnic shelter with 30-amp electric plugs is on-site. <br /><br />Picnic and serving tables, a campfire circle and grill are provided, as are accessible vault toilets, drinking water and trash collection. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Burgess Junction Visitor Center is 3 miles away. Shell Falls Visitor Center, at the overlook of Shell Falls, is about 22 miles southwest. Both centers offer interpretive trails, scenic views and educational displays about natural features like flora and fauna, and area history. <br /><br />The Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark is about 27 miles from the campground. This unique geoglyph signifies all creation and according to tribal beliefs, the circular shape of the wheel represents the earth, sun, moon, the cycles of life, seasons and day to night.<br /><br />Arrowhead Lodge, Bear Lodge and Elk View Inn are nearby, offering off-road vehicle rentals and fishing supplies, as well as dining options and general stores.",
