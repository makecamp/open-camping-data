    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Little Brooklyn Guard Station is located nine miles west of Centennial, Wyoming just off the Snowy Range Scenic Byway at an elevation of 10,340 feet. The guard station was constructed in 1931 as housing for Forest Service employees. Today, it is a unique year-round lodging experience for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in southeastern Wyoming.<br /><br />During the dry, summer months, guests can drive directly to the cabin; however during the snowy months, access is limited to snowmobiles, skis or snowshoes. Guests can expect to travel about three miles from the parking lot at Green Rock Recreation Area. Access is limited during the shoulder seasons of spring and fall when snow isn&rsquo;t deep enough to snowmobile on, but too deep to drive in. Please understand these limitations before deciding to reserve the cabin during this time of year. <br /><br />The cabin offers many modern amenities, but guests should be prepared to pack in some of their own supplies and gear, especially in winter.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>From valleys and canyons that rise steeply to jagged ridges, the area around the cabin boasts alpine lakes and a mixed forest of spruce, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir and aspen.<br /><br /> In the summer, guests can enjoy a view of wildflowers spilling down the meadow in front of the cabin to the edge of serene Little Brooklyn Lake. In winter, this same meadow is blanketed in pristine snow.<br /><br />Wildlife is abundant near the cabin, including elk, deer and coyotes. Migratory birds, squirrels and an occasional black bear find habitat in the forest as well.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A vast hiking trail system that accesses the highest elevations of the Snowy Range is available within 2 miles of the cabin. Hikers may attempt to summit Medicine Bow Peak, the highest peak in the Range at an elevation of 12,013 feet. Sheep Lakes Trail and Glacier Lakes Trails are also nearby.<br /><br /> Fishing is available at many alpine lakes and streams, including Brooklyn Lake and Little Brooklyn Lake, which is within walking distance of the cabin.<br /><br /> Winter brings deep powder snow for the snowmobiler, snowshoer and cross-country skier.<br /><br />Opportunities exist for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding and hunting in designated areas nearby.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin measures 28x22-ft. and has three rooms. It can accommodate up to seven people with two sets of bunk beds, one single bed and a double sofa bed. The cabin is heated by a wood stove and equipped with propane lights, propane cook stove, propane refrigerator, cookware and utensils for eating and cooking. The Forest Service supplies the propane and firewood. Please do not turn the refrigerator off when leaving as it takes too long to get it back to a cool temperature again for the next visitor. If there&rsquo;s a problem, report it to the Forest Service.<br /><br /> Drinking water is available during the summer months from a pump located outside the cabin. No running water is available inside the cabin. Water from the pump may freeze during the winter months, so guests must bring their own supply of water or melt snow for drinking, cooking and cleaning during this time. A vault toilet, grill and picnic table are located outside the cabin.<br /><br />Saddle or pack stock belonging to the renter may be kept in the meadow north of the guard station for an additional fee. Only certified weed-free hay or processed feed may be brought into the National Forest.<br /><br /> Guests need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, lanterns or flashlights, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Alltrash and food must be packed out, and guests must clean the cabin before leaving.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Guests can travel the Snowy Range Scenic Byway (Highway 130) in the summer. There are many campgrounds, picnic areas and hiking trails along its course. The small Snowy Range S",
