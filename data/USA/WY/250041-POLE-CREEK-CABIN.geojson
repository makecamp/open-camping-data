    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Pole Creek Cabin is unique in not only its quiet end-of-the-road location, but that it is also located along both a winter snowmobile trail and within the Pole Creek Cross Country Ski Area trail system.  In the spring the area is full of wildflowers and wildlife to view and in the fall it would make an ideal hunting camp.<br /><br />The cabin was built in the mid-1950s by the E-La-Ka-Wee boy scouts for a summer camp retreat.  In the early 1990s the cabin was refurbished and used as a winter snowmobile and ski warming hut. <br /><br />Winter access is possible from the Nordic Ski area parking lot at Forest Developed Road (FDR) 473 and Highway 16, but only by cross country skis or snowmobiles. <br /><br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4><b>The Pole Creek Cabin is located at 8,200 feet elevation on the Powder River Ranger District nearest Buffalo, Wyoming.  The cabin is surrounded by a lodgepole pine forest and is nestled along the edge of a meadow frequented by moose and a variety of other wildlife species.  A short drive from the cabin, one can tour the scenic Crazy Woman Canyon or fish in nearby Tie Hack Reservoir.</b><h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin is conveniently located for access to a wide variety of year-round activities. Because this cabin is located on both ski and snowmobile trails, it is a great winter activity destination. Some of the summer activities that take place in and around the area include fishing, mountain biking, ATV riding, hiking and hunting.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Pole Creek Cabin is a two room cabin that can sleep 4-6 people in the two sets of bunk beds with room on the floor for additional cots or sleeping bags.  The main room contains a wood stove for heat, kitchen cabinets and counter, table, chairs and benches.  Basic utensils are available in the cabinets. A fire ring and picnic table are just outside the door and a vault toilet is located nearby. Firewood is provided at the site. No drinking water, electricity, trash service or cook stove are provided. Guests should consider packing a cook stove and most other gear they would bring on a regular camping trip.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The town of Buffalo, Wyoming, is located within a half hour drive for amenities such as grocery stores, swimming pool, historic downtown and a museum.",
