An abundance of wildflowers color the landscape in summer. <br /><br />The Bridger-Teton National Forest offers more than 3.4 million acres of public lands for outdoor recreation. With its pristine watersheds, abundant wildlife and immense wildlands, the forest comprises a large part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest intact ecosystem in the lower 48 states.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Numerous creeks and the Little Greys River meander through the area, offering nice fishing opportunities. Hiking, biking, horseback riding and off-road vehicle trails are also in the vicinity. This includes Big Springs Trail and the 9-mile Bailey Creek Trail.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The nonelectric two-room dwelling fits eight overnight guests and an additional five guests may camp outside. A vault toilet, picnic table and fire ring are located outside behind the cabin. <br /><br />Bunkbeds with mattresses are provided.
