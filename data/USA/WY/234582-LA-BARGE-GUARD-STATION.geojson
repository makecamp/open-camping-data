    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Historic La Barge Guard Station is located 87 miles north of Kemmerer, Wyoming in the Hams Fork Area of Bridger-Teton National Forest. The cabin is situated in beautiful La Barge Meadow, among vibrant summer wildflowers at the base of pine-covered Commissary Ridge.<br /><br />Constructed in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the rustic cabin welcomes guests for sightseeing, hiking, fishing and more. Pets and horses are allowed at the cabin. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits near La Barge Creek in a grassy meadow at about 8,500 feet in elevation. Pine trees dot the land around the cabin and cover the surrounding hillsides.   <br /><br />Moose, elk, eagles and sandhill cranes are among the wildlife likely to be seen. An abundance of wildflowers color the landscape in summer. <br /><br />The Bridger-Teton National Forest offers more than 3.4 million acres of public land for outdoor recreation. With its pristine watersheds, abundant wildlife and immense wildlands, the forest comprises a large part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest intact ecosystem in the lower 48 states.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding are popular summer activities in the surrounding area. The Wagner Pass Trail begins behind the cabin, offering scenic hiking as it follows the Lander Cutoff Historical Trail. Snowmobiling and cross country skiing can be done right out the front door in winter. <br /><br />La Barge Creek offers pleasant trout fishing opportunities. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The guard station is a basic, 1930s style CCC cabin with two rooms. It sleeps six people on three bunkbeds with mattresses. The cabin is available year-round. <br /><br />The cabin is equipped with a propane oven, refrigerator, lights and a wood stove. In summer months, an indoor flush toilet, sink and shower are available. In winter, the indoor plumbing is not available. A vault toilet is located behind the cabin. Some dishes, pots, pans and utensils are provided, but the presence of these items is not guaranteed. <br /><br />No electricity, linens or bedding are provided.
