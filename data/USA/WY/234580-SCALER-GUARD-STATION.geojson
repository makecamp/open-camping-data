    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Historic Scaler Guard Station, located 78 miles north of Kemmerer, Wyoming, provides an excellent hideaway for cabin camping enthusiasts. The cabin allows pets and horses. Hiking, biking, horseback riding and off-road vehicle trails are in the vicinity. <br /><br />Constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the former ranger guard station dates back to 1937.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Sagebrush and grasses cover the area behind the cabin. A few pines are dispersed in the vicinity, but shade by the cabin is limited. <br /><br />Moose, elk, eagles and sandhill cranes are among the wildlife likely to be seen. An abundance of wildflowers color the landscape in summer. <br /><br />The Bridger-Teton National Forest offers more than 3.4 million acres of public lands for outdoor recreation. With its pristine watersheds, abundant wildlife and immense wildlands, the forest comprises a large part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest intact ecosystem in the lower 48 states.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The nearby Absaroka Ridge Trailhead leads hikers and horseback riders along Fontenelle Creek, and provides access into Pomeroy Basin. This trail also attracts big game hunters. Other trails throughout the LaBarge Creek area are ideal for mountain bikers and off-road vehicle riders. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The three-room guard station is a traditional 1930s-era forest cabin that sleeps six guests on three bunkbeds with mattresses. A picnic table and campfire ring are located outside in front of the cabin. <br /><br />From late May to mid-September, drinking water is available, along with an indoor flush toilet, sink and shower. The cabin is also equipped with a propane stove and oven, a propane refrigerator, lights and a wood stove. A vault toilet is located behind the structure for winter use. Some dishes, pots, pans and utensils are provided, however the presence of these items is not guaranteed.<br /><br />No electricity is available, and in winter, guests must bring their own water. Recommended items to bring include food, dish soap, dish rags, toilet paper, garbage bags and a flashlight.",
