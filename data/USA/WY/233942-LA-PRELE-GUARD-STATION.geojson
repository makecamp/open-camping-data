    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>La Prele Guard Station is located south of Douglas, Wyoming in Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest. It was originally built as a remote ranger station in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and was converted into a work center when the La Prele Ranger District was discontinued in 1956.<br /><br /> The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Today, it provides a unique lodging experience and delightful spot for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in south central Wyoming.<br /><br />The guard station is open from June through October each year and is accessible by car. Many modern conveniences are provided, but guests will need to bring a few of their own supplies to make their stay comfortable. There is no electricity, the Forest Service provides battery operated lanterns for use.

Mountains define the landscape and La Prele Creek flows nearby.<br /><br />Wildlife viewing is abundant near the cabin, including elk and deer. Migratory birds, squirrels and an occasional black bear find habitat in the forest as well.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, fishing, rock climbing, mountain biking, horseback riding and hunting can be found within the vicinity. Off-road vehicle riders can access trails in the area as well.<br /><br /> The trailhead for the Twin Peaks trail is three miles north of La Prele Guard Station and provides great access for elk and deer hunters. The trail meanders through both private and public land to the base of Twin Peaks. From the top of the peaks, views of the Laramie Mountains dominate the landscape.<br /><br />Anglers will enjoy fly fishing for a variety of trout at La Prele Creek within walking distance from the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The log structure has two bedrooms equipped with beds and mattresses that can accommodate up to ten people.
