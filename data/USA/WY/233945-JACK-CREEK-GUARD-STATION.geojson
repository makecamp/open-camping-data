    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Jack Creek Guard Station is located southwest of Saratoga, Wyoming, offering visitors a unique lodging experience in the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests.<br /><br />The guard station once served as the northern ranger cabin for the historic Encampment Ranger District. It was constructed by Ranger Evie Williams in 1934.    Oral history states that Ranger Williams spent most of his construction dollars on the material for the foundation and chimney, and used his own funds to finish the windows and roof.<br /><br />The guard station is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and offers guests recreation and relaxation in a delightful natural setting. The cabin is typically open from mid-June through mid-October and is accessible by vehicle. Basic amenities are provided, but guests will need to pack in some of their own supplies and gear.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>From open, high expanses to valleys and canyons that rise steeply to snowy ranges, the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests encompass mountain ranges, tributaries to the North Platte River and the Colorado River, and a mix of forested ecology with spruce, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, aspen and shrub lands.<br /><br />The Jack Creek Guard Station sits in a clearing with lodgepole pine, aspen and mixed conifer forest at an elevation of 8,500 feet. Wildlife viewing is abundant in the area, including elk, deer, bear and moose.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Opportunities exist in the area for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail is approximately five miles west of the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The one-room cabin is furnished with two sets of bunk beds and can accommodate up to four people. Heat is provided by a combination wood and propane cook stove, and firewood is provided. Basic cooking and eating utensils and propane lights are supplied.<br /><br /> Water is available during the summer months from a hand pump just outside or from Jack Creek Campground, which is a mile away. There is no indoor plumbing, but a vault toilet is located nearby. A picnic table and campfire ring are also available.<br /><br /><h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The grave site of Ranger Evie Williams is located just a short distance from the guard station.",
