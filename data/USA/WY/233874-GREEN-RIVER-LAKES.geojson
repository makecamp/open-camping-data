    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Green River Lakes Campground is located near the shores of beautiful Lower Green River Lake, at an elevation of 8,000 feet. The lake sits on the western edge of the rugged Wind River Range in Wyoming. Visitors enjoy hiking and backpacking into the adjacent Bridger Wilderness, as well as fishing and canoeing on the lake.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Square Top Mountain towers over scenic Green River Lakes. This unique peak is part of the Wind River Range and tops out at an elevation of 11,581 feet. Most campsites afford scenic views of the peak and the lake below. Lodgepole pines dot the campground, offering very limited shade. Wildlife and summer wildflowers are abundant in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The lake is open to small watercraft only, making it an excellent location for canoeing and kayaking. A primitive, carry-down boat launch is located at the lakeshore. Anglers fish for brook, cutthroat, rainbow and mackinaw trout.<br /><br />Hiking and horseback riding into the Bridger Wilderness and Wind River Range are popular activities enjoyed by visitors to the area. Trails in the area include the Highline Trail and Lakeside Trail. A trailhead parking area, horse corral and water trough are just outside the campground. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground contains three large-group campsites with picnic tables, campfire circles and grills. Sites A and B can accommodate up to 35 people each, and site C can accommodate up to 50 people. Single-family campsites are also available within the campground, on a first-come, first-served basis.<br /><br />Vault toilets and drinking water are provided. A campground host is located on-site.
