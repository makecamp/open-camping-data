    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The historic Meadows Guard Station is a quiet hideaway beneath tall pines, where deer graze in the open meadow pasture nearby. Located 29 miles from Alpine, the cabin allows horses and provides corrals. <br /><br />Built in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the cabin presents a year-round backcountry playground for activities like horseback riding, fishing, off-road vehicle riding and snowmobiling. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, guests have the convenience of a shower and flush toilet. Horse corrals are available, but horses cannot be turned out into the pasture.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in a shady, wooded area in the valley of Greys River. Meadow Creek runs beside the cabin. <br /><br />Moose, elk, eagles, and sandhill cranes are among the wildlife likely to be seen. An abundance of wildflowers color the landscape in summer. <br /><br />The Bridger-Teton National Forest offers more than 3.4 million acres of public lands for outdoor recreation. With its pristine watersheds, abundant wildlife and immense wildlands, the forest comprises a large part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest intact ecosystem in the lower 48 United States.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Greys River is nearby, offering pleasing fishing opportunities. Hiking, off-road vehicle riding, horseback riding and mountain biking are popular summer activities. Snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are excellent winter activities.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The rustic two-room guard station sleeps six people on three sets of bunkbeds with mattresses. Parking accommodates a maximum of one RV or trailer. The cabin has running water, a flush toilet and shower, but these are only available from approximately Memorial Day to Labor Day.  <br /><br />No electricity is available, but a propane refrigerator, lights and cooktop are provided along with a wood stove for heat. The kitchen also has a sink and a table with chairs. <br /><br />Water is only available from late May to early September.
