    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Muddy Guard Cabin dates back to the late 1930s and offers views of wildflower-topped meadows and snow-capped mountains. Originally used as a Forest Service guard station, the quaint cabin appeals to those looking for a peaceful getaway with hiking, horseback riding and fishing. <br /><br />Winter access is possible, but only by cross country skis, snowmobiles or snowshoes along a 200-yard stretch of road. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated in a large open meadow near Muddy Creek at about 7,800 feet elevation. A dense forest of lodgepole pine surrounds the meadow. A short distance northeast lies Crazy Woman Canyon. <br /><br />Moose, deer and elk may be spotted in the area. Summer climates are typically warm days in the 70s and 80s and cool nights.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing in Muddy Creek is enjoyable and various trails for hiking and mountain biking can be found in the area. Horseback riders appreciate the convenience of keeping horses at the cabin and heading out on surrounding trails. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the cabin is made of peeled logs with saddle corner notching. Outside, a horse corral and hitching post are available. Inside is a kitchen and two bedrooms. One bedroom is furnished with two bunkbeds and the other has a double bed. The kitchen comes with an electric cooking stove, a wood stove for heat, a small refrigerator and a grey water sink. Furniture includes a sofa, dining table and chairs and a dresser. Cleaning supplies, a snow shovel, fire extinguisher, carbon monoxide alarm and fire alarms are also included. <br /><br />No drinking water is available.
