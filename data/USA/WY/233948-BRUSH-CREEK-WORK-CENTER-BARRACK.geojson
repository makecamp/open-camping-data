    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Brush Creek Work Center is located in the Brush Creek drainage on the western slopes of the Medicine Bow Mountain Range in southern Wyoming.<br /><br /> The original structure was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937, reflective of Forest Service architecture and philosophy. The current facility was built in 1981 and offers a comfortable, unique lodging opportunity in the Routt National Forest from December through April.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible by car and offers many modern amenities. Guests only need to bring a few of their own supplies and gear. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Brush Creek Work Center sits in a valley formed by the Barrett Creek and Brush Creek drainages at an elevation of 8,100 feet. The buildings are bordered by dense pine forest to the north and east, and open sagebrush to the west.<br /><br />From open, high expanses to valleys and canyons that rise steeply to snowy ranges, the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests encompass mountain ranges, tributaries to the North Platte River and the Colorado River, and a mix of forested ecology with spruce, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, aspen and shrub lands.<br /><br />This diverse landscape supports a variety of wildlife species. Bald eagles and ospreys may be seen perched on tall trees or in flight. Lucky guests may catch a glimpse of pronghorn, elk, moose, deer or black bear. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin offers an ideal winter playground, with a snowy landscape perfect for recreation. Snowmobiling, skiing and snowshoeing are popular activities. The Brush Creek Cross-Country Ski Trails are made up of loop trails winding through aspen, lodgepole pine stands and reclaimed clear-cuts. The frequency of trail grooming depends on weather conditions and equipment. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This bi-level house can accommodate up to eight people comfortably in four bedrooms with a set of twin beds in each. The small living room has a TV, but reception is weak. The large kitchen and dining area is equipped with a refrigerator, stove, microwave, basic kitchen utensils and cooking supplies. Two bathrooms include showers and flush toilets. The house has electricity and heat.<br /><br /> Guests should bring a few of their own supplies, including food, sleeping bags, pillows, towels, dish soap, extra toilet paper and garbage bags. Additional light sources should be brought for emergencies. All trash and food should be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.",
