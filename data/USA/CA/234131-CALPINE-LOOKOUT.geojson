The lookout was actively used every summer until 1975. It is a three-story structure with external stairs. The top room or observation cab is the only rented space at this time. <br /><br />Calpine sits at an elevation of 5,980 feet in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Tahoe National Forest, approximately 40 miles from Truckee, California. The lookout is ideally suited for over-the-snow ski or snowmobile access.<br /><br />The lookout does not have electricity or water. It contains propane-powered appliances. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout tower sits on a hill in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, within 15 miles of Sand Pond and Gold Lake. Wildlife is abundant in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking and mountain biking trails are within 15 miles of the lookout. The Pacific Crest Trail can be accessed approximately 20 miles away.<br /><br />For outings on the water, Gold Lake is northwest of the lookout, and Sand Pond is west of Calpine.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The interior of the cab measures 14 by 14 and currently has two single beds, a dry sink, a table and four chairs, three propane lights, a propane heater, a propane stove/oven and a fire finder.
