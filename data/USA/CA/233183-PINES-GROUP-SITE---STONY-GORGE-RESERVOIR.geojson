    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Pines Group Site is conveniently located at the Stony Gorge Dam, just 18 miles downstream from East Park Dam and 5 miles west of Fruto in western Glenn county. Stony Gorge Dam, Orland Project, was completed in 1928 and is a concrete slab and buttress structure with a height of 139 feet and a crest length of 868 feet. The group campsite area is complete with views of the Stony Gorge Reservoir and the scenic hills beyond. In addition to the Pines Group Site, there are free, first-come, first-served campsites in the area. Theres plenty of open space to throw a ball around, stroll, and explore the areas wildflowers. Plus the warm-water fishery with an 18-mile shoreline is huge draw for avid fishermen. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Pines Group Site is set on the northwest tip of the reservoir along 18 miles of lake shoreline. The area is part of the foothills beside the Mendocino National Forest, which straddles the Coastal Mountain Range. <h4>Recreation:</h4>All water sports are highly recommended at this campground. The area boasts excellent boating and shoreline accessibility. One boat ramp useable most of the summer, is dependent on water levels. Available bass species include largemouth and smallmouth bass of Texan strain that grow faster and mature earlier (10 to 12 pounds) and a thriving bluegill and crappie population (2 to 3 pounds). Catfishing is good year-round (up to 20 pounds). Swimming in the warm, refreshing waters is also popular. <h4>Facilities:</h4>A boat launch is located 1 mile from the campsite, and the group area is ideal for swimming. Picnic tables are dispersed so that some are shaded by trees, while others capture the warm sun. The camping area has a stone fire pit and a large brick barbecue.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Hike the Red Mountain Trail for 360-degree views of Black Butte Lake, Lassen Peak, and Mount Shasta. Dont miss out on a scenic drive through the Mendocino Forest either.",
