It ranges from 1,000 ft. in elevation at Shasta Lake, to the spectacular Mt. Shasta with an elevation of 14,162 feet.<br /><br />The Shasta-Trinity includes portions of 5 designated Wilderness Areas: Castle Crags, Chanchelulla, Mount Shasta, Trinity Alps and Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel.<br /><br /> It also sits among 7 major geographic and botanic regions: the Coast Range, Klamath Mountains, Willamette Valley, te Cascade Mountains, the High Desert, the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Central Valley.<br /><br />The Upper McCloud River features the Upper, Middle and Lower Falls, which cascade over basalt lava flows, impressing visitors and kayakers alike. <h4>Recreation:</h4>During the late spring, summer and early fall, the McCloud River is the most popular attraction in this area, offering fishing, swimming, camping, kayaking and plenty of photography opportunities. <br /><br />The Upper McCloud River, located from the point the river dumps into the McCloud Reservoir to its source, is a popular spot for trout fishing. Anglers can find rainbow, brook and McCloud River red band trout.  The Lower McCloud River, which begins below the dam at the McCloud Reservoir, offers many additional angling opportunities as well.<br /><br />The nearby McCloud River Falls Trail offers hikers the opportunity to view all 3 of the waterfalls, as well as take in breathtaking views of Mt. Shasta.<br /><br />For hikers looking to cool off in the summer heat, the Middle Falls and Lower Falls both offer popular swimming holes, for those brave enough to take on the cool waters. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Vehicle access to Camp 4 is mostly on paved roads, but the last 1/4 mile is gravel. The facility can accommodate 10 vehicles and up to 30 guests, with a maximum of 10 tents plus 5 RV or motor homes. <br /><br />The campground has no water or electricity, but there are picnic tables, vault toilets and campfire rings provided, as well as trash collection-visitors are expected to bring their own trash bags.<br /><br />Water is available at the McCloud Ranger Station.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest services and amenities are 9 miles from Camp 4 in McCloud, a historic mill town that offers opportunities for golfing, eating out, shopping and sightseeing. <br /><br />Throughout Shasta-Trinity National Forest, there are access points for the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2,663-mile trail stretching from Mexico to Canada.",
