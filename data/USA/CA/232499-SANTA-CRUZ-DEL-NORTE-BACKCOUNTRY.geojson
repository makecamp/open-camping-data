    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>For a truly remote getaway full of backpacking and breathtaking scenery, take a backcountry trip to Santa Cruz Islands Del Norte campground. On the way, find nesting seabirds, sea lions and seals, and many other animals and plants on the island. The landscape varies from pine forests, to grasslands and marshes. Chaparral, a region of shrubland, unique to California, also decorates the rolling hills. <p>How did the island get its name? Legend has it that in 1769, a Spanish priest accidentally left his cross-tipped staff on the island. A Chumash Indian found it and returned the staff to its rightful owner. The Spaniards were so impressed that they named the island after the good deed: the Island of the Sacred Cross.  </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4> Del Norte is nestled in a shaded oak grove and provides scenic views of the islands pristine coastline. Santa Cruz boasts two rugged mountain ranges that climb above 2000 ft., a sweeping valley, deep canyons, and year-round springs and streams. To top it off, its bordered by 77 miles of coastline cliffs, beaches, tide pools, and sea caves.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Explore the backcountry with lots of hiking and fishing. Ocean sports like snorkeling, kayaking, and swimming are possible, but due to high swells and strong currents, these activities are recommended for experts only. <p>Dedicated hikers can challenge themselves with the 16-mile Prisoners to Scorpion hike. The hike is best done over two days, making Del Norte an ideal stopping point for the night. Much of the hike is drenched in sunshine, so be sure to pack plenty of water. </p><h4>Facilities:</h4>The campsite is truly primitive and designed for seasoned backpackers. Entry to the site requires a strenuous three to four-mile uphill hike, and you must carry in your own camping gear, food, and water.",
