    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Coyote Point sits along New Hogan Lake in the brush-covered foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.<br /><br />With summer temperatures regularly soaring above 90 degrees, visitors find comfort in the refreshing waters of New Hogan Lake, conveniently accessed from the campground.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The 4,400 surface-acre lake was created in 1964 with the completion of New Hogan Dam. When full, the lake has 50 miles of shoreline and extends nearly 8 miles upstream to the confluence of the north and south forks of the Calaveras River. <br /><br />The dam was built to provide flood protection to the city of Stockton and water for irrigation, drinking and hydroelectric power, and it now offers recreation opportunities for thousands of visitors each year.<br /><br />The New Hogan area supports a wide variety of wildlife. The foothills are home to grey fox, mule deer, coyote, turkey, mountain lion, bobcat and rattlesnakes.<br /><br />New Hogan is also a wintering home for bald eagles. The south shore of the lake has been designated as a wildlife viewing area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Boating is a popular pastime, with boat ramps conveniently located around the lake. The large surface area allows for plenty of water skiing, wake boarding, jet skiing and more.<br /><br />Year-round fishing for stripers, bass, crappie, bluegill and catfish is perfect for experts and beginners alike. Some of the biggest fish are found in less than 25 feet of water.<br /><br />The &quot;River of Skulls&quot; hiking trail is located below the dam at the Monte Vista Recreation Area. The trail also includes a staging area for an eight mile equestrian trail on a scenic loop that winds along the lake and through the foothill chaparral. Trail guides are available at the park office.<br /><br />Bike trails suitable for the beginners as well as advanced riders are found on the west side of the lake and next to the group camping area. An easy 3-mile trail connects the park office with Acorn Campground.<br /><br />Hunting with bow or shotgun during the open season is permitted in certain areas of the lake. Upland game such as turkey, quail and dove is available and waterfowl includes a variety of duck and geese.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Coyote Point offers a spacious group campsite that can accommodate up to 50 guests.
