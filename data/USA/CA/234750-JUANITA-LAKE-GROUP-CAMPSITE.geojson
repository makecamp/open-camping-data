    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Juanita Lake campground offers a 50 person group campsite adjacent to Juanita Lake on the Klamath National Forest.  The lake offers a unique combination of recreation opportunities including many water-based activities like fishing and swimming. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The partially shaded campground sits at an altitude of 5,130 feet and is located on the shores of Juanita Lake surrounded by a ponderosa pine forest.  The lake is a favorite bird watching area with bald eagles and osprey regularly fishing the lake. Sit among the pines and fish or watch a diverse array of wildlife that uses the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The 55 acre Juanita Lake is excellent for small rowboats, rafts, and canoes. There is a paved boat launch ramp, a dock in the summer, and fish cleaning station. No motors are permitted on the lake. The lake is regularly stocked with trout and has a bass and catfish population. <p>Those wanting to explore will enjoy the 1.5 mile paved, barrier free trail that circles the lake with two fishing jetties for easy lake access. For the more ambitious hiker, there is a 6 mile hike with a 2,700 foot elevation gain climbing up to Ball Mountain Lookout.</p><p>Visitors interested in cooling off will delight in a swim or simply wading and water-play from the shoreline.</p><h4>Facilities:</h4>The group site is located next to Juanita Lake in a private location away from the main campground. There are four parking areas that can accommodate approximately 15 vehicles. The site offers drinking water (two spigots), eight picnic tables, a large group campfire ring, four pedestal grills, eight lantern hangers, five bear-proof trash cans and two vault toilets.  All camp/tent areas have views of the lake. There is limited RV parking at the group site. This site is more suited for non-RV group use.                                                                                                           <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Butte Valley Wildlife Area is within four miles.",
