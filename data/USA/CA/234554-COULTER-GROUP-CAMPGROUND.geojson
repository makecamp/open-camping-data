    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>At Coulter Group Campground groups can relax and enjoy the experience of being outdoors without traveling too far from the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. <br /><br />The Angeles Crest Highway, a scenic byway that meanders through oak thickets, chaparral, high desert landscapes and pine tree forests is located nearby.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground sits at an elevation of 5,300 feet, less than a mile from the San Gabriel Wilderness. Over 36,000 acres within the Angeles National Forest are designated as the San Gabriel Wilderness Area and have been set aside to preserve their wilderness character.<br /><br />The area encompasses some extremely rugged terrain, ranging in elevation from 1,600 to 8,200 feet. The lower elevations are covered with dense chaparral which rapidly changes to pine and fir-covered slopes and majestic peaks with glimpses of wildflowers and a variety of wildlife as you enter the upper elevations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors can explore the Silver Moccasin Trail, open to hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking. The 58-mile trail accesses the extensive Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from Canada all the way to Mexico. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground has four picnic tables, a vault toilet, group campfire rings and a drinking waterfaucet. The maximum RV length is 40 feet.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visit the Chilao Visitor Center, just 1.5 miles north of the campground. The center provides exhibits and interesting information about the region and excellent bird watching opportunities. Visitors can learn about the 10 species of woodpeckers in the area.",
