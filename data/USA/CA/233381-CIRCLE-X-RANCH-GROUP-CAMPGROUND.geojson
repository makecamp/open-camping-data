    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Are you searching for a weekend getaway with mountain overlooks and sunny, sandy beaches?  <p>Your vacation destination may be a short drive from Los Angeles, California! Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area offers many opportunities to shake off the stresses of city life and immerse yourself in the beauty of nature. </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>Tucked in the canyons above Malibu and nestled below majestic Boney Mountain, you will find Circle X Ranch. This former Boy Scout camp offers many opportunities for exploration and adventure. Journey to Sandstone Peak, the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains, and see several of the Channel Islands on a clear day. Enjoy a visit to the Grotto or a creekside picnic. Reserve the Group Camp and listen to coyote songs at night. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Travel one of the many trails that wind through this rare coastal Mediterranean ecosystem. The plants you see here, such as coastal sage scrub and mixed chaparral, are adapted to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Keep an eye out for red shank chaparral, a tree-like shrub with reddish-brown bark, clusters of thread-like leaves, and small bunches of white flowers in July and August. <br /> <br />From the dry, rocky slopes near Sandstone Peak to the lush fern-studded Grotto, Circle X Ranch provides a wide variety of recreational possibilities. Linger here for a while, and experience the ambiance of this secluded mountain retreat. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Located below the Ranger Contact Station at Cirlce X Ranch. Check-in here with park staff before heading down to your campsite.  <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Enjoy a visit to the Grotto or a creekside picnic at the trailhead next to the campground. <br /> <br />Grotto Trail 3.5 miles round trip, moderate to strenuous; no bikes, no horses.
