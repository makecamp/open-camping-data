    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Loon Lake Chalet is situated next to Loon Lake in a granite bowl, and offers year-round, drive-to access for excellent backcountry skiing and hiking. The three-story chalet boasts excellent views of the Sierras and the lake. Though the chalet looks fancy, guests should not not expect hotel luxuries, but rather a semi-rustic experience. <br /><br />The Sacramento Municipal Utility District built the chalet in 1989, originally intended as a day-use winter facility. Due to public demand, the second floor warming room was made available for overnight rental, and a third floor was soon added. The facility is still open for day-use on winter weekends and holidays, so overnight guests should expect to share the ground floor with day-use visitors. A ranger in residence sleeps in the patrol room on the ground floor.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The chalet is nestled in the forest on the western edge of Loon Lake at an elevation of 6,348 feet. The lake spans 76,200 acres. Sub-alpine red fir and lodgepole forests, granite bowls and a spectacular view of the Crystal Range of the Sierra Nevada Mountains characterize the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Popular summer activities include hiking, backpacking in Desolation Wilderness, fishing, mountain biking, horseback riding and off-road driving on the 22-mile Rubicon 4WD Trail. Anglers delight in rainbow and brown trout, while boaters head out for thrilling water skiing on Loon Lake.<br /><br />In winter, the chalet is the focal point of the Loon Lake Winter Recreation Area, which offers many miles of non-groomed backcountry skiing trails.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The chalet has three levels and can accommodate up to 20 guests. It features a large deck off the second floor with a wide stairway accessing the parking area. Vault toilets are attached to the building but are accessed from outside. The bottom floor is the ski patrol room, the second floor is the warming room and the third floor is the sleeping loft. <br /><br />Electricity plus hot and cold water are provided. Garbage service is offered in summer months. The warming room has electric heat and is equipped with picnic tables, benches, a queen-sized futon couch, two wood couches, a gas fireplace and small dryer. The kitchen contains a double sink, hot and cold water, a range top stove, microwave oven and a small under-the-counter refrigerator. Pots and pans are provided. Additional tables and benches are outside on the deck.<br /><br />No showers are available. Guests should bring food, sleeping bags, plates, drinking glasses and utensils, garbage bags, flashlights, maps and a compass, first aid supplies and tire chains. Electrical outlets may be used for crock pots, microwaves, coffeemakers, electric frying pans and similar small appliances. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/documents/rogs/rog_rental_loonchalet.pdf>Click here</a> for more information about the chalet.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest general store is an hour away at Ice House Reservoir.
