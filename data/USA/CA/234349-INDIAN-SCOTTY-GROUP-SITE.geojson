    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Indian Scotty Group Site is located next to the Scott River in Klamath National Forest. Visitors enjoy swimming, tubing, rafting and fishing on the river. Many hiking trailheads are nearby, leading into the Marble Mountain Wilderness.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The riverside group site sits in a forest of cedar, Douglas fir and Pondarosa pine at an elevation of 2,400 feet. Mount Shasta, not part of the Klamath, is visible from some areas within the compound. <br><br>The Klamath National Forest encompasses nearly 2 million acres of land straddling the California and Oregon border. The Klamath encompasses a vast array of mountains, streams and lakes and, at elevations ranging from 450 to 8,900 feet, is home to diverse plant life and nearly 400 animal species.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Campers can swim or wade off the gravel banks of the Scott River. Tubing and rafting on the river are popular options, as is trout fishing.<br><br>Several Marble Mountain Wilderness trailheads are easily accessed from the site, including Lovers Camp, the main portal to Marble Valley and Marble Rim.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Indian Scotty is set in an open grassy area surrounded by trees. The site is particularly suited for RVs up to 30 feet in length because of its configuration. Some campsites have views of the river. A campfire circle and grill are provided.  A playground is available on-site.",
