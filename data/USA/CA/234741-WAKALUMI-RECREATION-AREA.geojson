    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Wakalumi Recreation Area is a primitive Group Horse Camping area located at Hensley Lake in the foothills of central California, 50 miles north of Fresno. The lake area offers many recreational opportunities, such as swimming, water skiing, fishing, hiking and horseback riding. The lake attracts a growing number of visitors per year. It is within a short drive to Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, as well as the Sierra National Forest. The lake was created by the construction of Hidden Dam on the Fresno River. With over 20 miles of shoreline, it is a popular vacation spot for families and those who enjoy water activities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Wakalumi is located below the dam at Hensley Lake. It is surrounded by the oak woodlands of the Sierra Nevada foothills, offering a mixture of sun and shade. The area has significant historical value as it was once home to the Miwok and Yokut Native American Tribes. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The area is packed with opportunities for outdoor fun. Hiking and horseback riding are available for campers in our wildlife areas. Certain times of the year, Wakalumi campers have access to the Fresno River for fishing from their camping area. Other campers enjoy boating, water skiing and fishing on the water. Bank fishermen have easy access to the lakes shoreline. Lake fishing is particularly good in the coves where largemouth black bass, crappie, bluegill and catfish are found in abundance. Rainbow trout are stocked in the lake each winter. <br /><br />On the other side of the lake, there is a swim beach, a disc golf course and a hiking, mountain biking and equestrian trail. One hiking trail is located within 10 miles of the campground. <br /><br />Educational programs are offered at the campgrounds amphitheater every Saturday night during the summer months. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Wakalumi Recreation Area provides one large group campsite for up to 50 people, including horse trailers.
