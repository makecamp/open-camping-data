Many trailheads are nearby, leading visitors through the scenic forest that surrounds the campground.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is located 45 miles outside San Bernardino at an elevation of 7,132 feet. It is nestled in a mixed conifer forest with a grassy understory. Mature trees provide much shade throughout the area, but open meadows are also available.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The campground provides access to a variety of hiking and mountain biking trails, including the Grays Peak Trail, which leads to Hanna Flat Campground. The 3.4-mile trail starts with some steep climbing before easing into a gradual incline after a mile. The Butler Park Fire Lookout is a short, 1-mile hike or bike from the campground.<br /><br />Fishing and boating in nearby Big Bear Lake are popular activities. Anglers can look forward to a catch of trout, bluegill, crappie, catfish and largemouth bass. Because of cold water temperatures and the presence of underwater obstacles near the shorelines, swimming at the lake is somewhat discouraged, unless done in designated areas.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground offers one large group site for tent and RV camping. It can accommodate up to 40 people and eight vehicles. Parking spurs are gravel and utility hookups are not provided.<br /><br />The campsite is equipped with several tables, a campfire circle and grills. Vault toilets are provided.
