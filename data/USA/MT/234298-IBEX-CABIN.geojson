    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Ibex Cabin was constructed in 1939 as a shelter for Forest Service rangers working within the Shields Ranger District of the Gallatin National Forest of south-central Montana. It is available for summer and winter recreational use, and provides a peaceful, remote mountain retreat.<br /><br />Guests can drive to the cabin from June through October, although high clearance, four-wheel drive vehicles are strongly recommended. The access road to the cabin may get muddy in the rain, so guests may want to call ahead for road conditions. In the winter, the cabin is only accessible by a 5.5-mile ski, snowshoe or snowmobile trip. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.<br /><br />This cabin offers very rustic accommodations with limited amenities, so guests should beprepared to bring most of their own supplies and gear to make their stay an enjoyable experience.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The rustic cabin is nestled at the edge of a meadow in the foothills of the Crazy Mountains, at an elevation of 6,600 feet. A forest of Lodgepole pine grows behind the cabin, and views from the front reveal the 7,354-foot peak of Ibex Mountain.<br /><br />The surrounding meadow bursts with color from wildflowers in the summer. Mule deer, porcupine and elk may be spotted around the cabin. Several bird species that inhabit this area include bald eagles, owls, jays, western meadowlarks and mountain bluebirds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>There are a number of trails in the area for hikers, equestrians and snowmobilers. The Ibex Trail and Cottonwood Lake Trail are the closest to the cabin. The trailhead for CottonwoodLake can be accessed three miles up the road from the cabin. Trails in the area may sometimes cross private property, so guests should obtain permission before using them.<br /><br />Winter recreation includes snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Big game hunting is also a popular activity in this area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin has bunk beds with mattresses to accommodate up to four people. Other amenities include a wood stove for heat, a propane lantern, table, chairs, axe, splitting maul, bucket, broom, mop and shovel.<br /><br />An outhouse with vault toilet is located outside. A limited amount of firewood is provided, although its not available during July and August. A campfire ring is located outside, but guests should collect or bring their own firewood for outside fires.<br /><br /> Electricity and water are not available. Guests must bring their own water supply, as well as cooking gear, propane canisters for the lantern, bedding, matches, newspaper, first aid kit, dishes and utensils, toilet paper and other necessities. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash carried out, prior to leaving.",
