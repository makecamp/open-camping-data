    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The West Fork of Rock Creek Cabin is located on the western edge of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and is open for reservations year-round. It is a quaint cabin that provides a great experience in the mountains of southwestern Montana. The cabin offers access to numerous trails and wildlife viewing, as well as a comfortable place to picnic and spend the nights.<br /><br />There are six structures at the site, which was once used as a Forest Service Guard Station and later as a youth camp. Only the westernmost of the two small cabins at the south end has been restored and is available to the public.<br /><br />  The site can typically be accessed by vehicle, depending on conditions. Excessive snowfall may require renters to walk about 200 yards from the plowed highway to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The log cabin is situated near the Anaconda Pintler Wilderness in an open meadow surrounded by evergreens. The area is known for its high, rugged and beautiful mountain scenery, where hundreds of mountain goats make their home. The cabin is close to some scenic, clear mountain streams and ponds, where a number of wildlife species, including elk, moose, deer, mountain lions and bears, come to water (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/bdnf/learning/safety-ethics/?cid=FSM9_003342>learn more about bear safety</a>).<br /><br />There is a fenced pasture for horses but you must check the fence for damage before using it. As a reminder, pelletized or certified weed seed free feed and straw is required in all National Forests in Montana; please plan accordingly.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A variety of hiking and horseback riding trails are available in the area, as well as ample wildlife viewing. Visitors enjoy cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.<br /><br /> Fishing is popular in the many clear mountain streams adjacent to the cabin. Anglers may see plentiful trout populations, as the area is known for some of the worlds finest trout streams.<br /><br /> The cabin is located along the scenic Skalkaho Highway, which links Hamilton and Philipsburg, in southwestern Montana. The drive into the Sapphire Mountains is primitive and was once a trail widely used by Native Americans. The roadway was built to provide access between mining areas and agricultural communities in the Bitterroot Valley. The road leads to Skalkaho Falls in the nearby Bitterroot National Forest; however, the road may be closed to traffic in the winter.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The primitive, one-room cabin is equipped with two sets of bunk beds with mattress pads that can sleep up to four people. It has a table and chairs, basic cooking utensils and minimal cooking pots. A propane stove is available, but fuel is not supplied. A wood stove is provided for heat. Firewood is available, but not guaranteed.<br /><br /> Drinking water is not available during the winter months. An accessible outhouse with a pit toilet is located a short distance north of the cabin.<br /><br />There is no cell phone service available in the area. Guests need to bring their own sleeping bags, pillows, lanterns or flashlights, disposable propane fuel canisters, matches, food, toilet paper and garbage bags. Guests are asked to replenish the supply of split wood and kindling, pack out all trash and food, and clean the cabin before leaving.",

    "FacilityDirections": "From Philipsburg, travel south on Highway 1 for just over 6 miles. Turn right onto Skalkaho Highway/Highway 38 and travel west for about 13 miles. The entrance to the cabin is on the left, behind a locked gate, which uses the same key code as the cabin. The last 200 yards of the road may be closed due to snowfall during the winter months. <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/bdnf/maps-pubs>Maps</a> may be purchased by calling the Pintler Ranger District.",
