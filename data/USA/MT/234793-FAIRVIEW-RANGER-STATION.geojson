    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>This remote cabin was built in 1908 and served as an administration building for the Wolf Creek District of the Blackfeet National Forest. The Blackfeet NF was dissolved in 1935 becoming part of the Kootenai &amp; Flathead NF. Fairview was used as a remote work station until 1980. In 2011 major work was done to restore the cabin and put it on the rental system.  The cabin is open year-round and is accessible by car. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Fairview Ranger Station is situated near Wolf Creek at an elevation of 2,995 feet within the Salish Mountain Range of the Rocky Mountains in the Kootenai National Forest. Wolf Creek and its many tributaries provide habitat for a variety of trout and big game animals.

Hiking, fishing, floating, hunting, scenic and historical driving tours are just some of the activities to be enjoyed.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 900 square foot cabin can sleep up to 6 people and comes furnished with one double bed and two twin beds with mattresses upstairs and one double futon and twin futon with mattresses downstairs. <br /><br />Other amenities include a propane stove, refrigerator, heater and lights, table and chairs, table settings for eight, kitchen tools, pots and pans and cleaning gear.
