The tower contains a few modern amenities, including electricity, but allows guests to personalize their visits with their own supplies. A variety of recreational opportunities exist in the surrounding mountains, but the view is usually what attracts people to the tower.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout is a 14-by-14 structure atop a 20 foot tower. It was built in 1933 and staffed by Forest Service employees until the mid-80s, when it was opened to the public for recreation purposes. The tower is now listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.<br /><br />The forest contains a wide variety of trees, plants and wildlife, and is home to mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk, moose, deer and grizzly and black bears (learn about <a href=http://fwp.mt.gov/recreation/safety/wildlife/bears/bearCountry.html>bear safety</a>). Both the bald and golden eagle reside in the forest, along with trumpeter swan, herons and dozens of varieties of ducks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors enjoy hunting and hiking. There are a variety of trails that lead from the lookout into the surrounding mountains and valleys. <br /><br />Seeley Lake is located about 2 miles east of Double Arrow and is open to fishing, boating and other water-related recreation.
