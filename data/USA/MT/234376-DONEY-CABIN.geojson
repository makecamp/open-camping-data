    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Open year-round, Doney Cabin is a great way to access the various seasonal activities available in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, in western Montana. While sportsmen enjoy the cabin during bow and rifle seasons, it is popular among snowmobiling enthusiasts in the winter and hikers in the summer. The cabin is in a very remote location, giving anyone an outdoor recreational experience they will never forget.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is limited by weather conditions. Four-wheel drive and high clearance vehicles are necessary year-round. Excessive snowfall prohibits any vehicles from accessing the cabin and guests will need to plan for cross-country skiing or snowmobiling up to 15 miles. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The rustic, log mining cabin is near Doney Lake in the Flint Creek Range. It was donated to the Forest Service by the family of a man who spent much time there. Water in the lake is not recommended for swimming or drinking. The lake is used as an irrigation reservoir and does not contain any fish.<br /><br />The Flints have typical Rocky Mountain fauna, including a few mountain goats. The area is popular for hunting deer, elk and blue grouse. Dozens of alpine lakes in the range provide good fishing. Bears may also frequent the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing is popular in any of the mountain lakes in the vicinity. Access to the lakes will require extensive hiking. The area is home to a variety of trails for hiking, including one that climbs up from the cabin into a series of glacial lakes high in the mountains. Hunting is also popular in the surrounding areas.<br /><br />Guests also enjoy snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the area during the winter. Various weather conditions can increase avalanche danger in the area and visitors are encouraged to carry proper backcountry equipment, including a beacon, shovel and probe, while recreating.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The primitive, one-room cabin has bunkbeds that sleep up to six people. It has a table and chairs, basic cooking utensils and dishes, as well as a wood stove for heat. Firewood is provided but cannot be guaranteed. There is no electricity, plumbing or water available at the cabin. An outhouse with a vault toilet is located near the cabin.<br /><br />Guests will need to bring water for cooking, cleaning and drinking, as well as bedding, towels, soap, dishes, cooking equipment and fuel, toilet paper, garbage bags and an axe. A broom and dust pan are provided and visitors are required to carry out all trash. Guests are also asked to clean the facility prior to their departure. Cell phone service is non-existent in the area.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Interesting day trips might include touring the Grant-Kohrs Ranch, which is operated by the National Park Service just outside of Deer Lodge, which is about 17 miles from the cabin. In Deer Lodge, visitors can tour the old Montana Territorial Prison, which was built by convict labor in 1871. Both are on nationally recognized historic sites.",
