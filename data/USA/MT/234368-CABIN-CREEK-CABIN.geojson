    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cabin Creek Cabin is a rustic, single-room structure that was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. It offers a few basic amenities, so guests will need to bring most of their own supplies and gear to ensure an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Summer access is only by horse, foot, or motorcycle which are allowed July 16th - Oct. 14th annually for up to six miles on Trail 151. All-terrain vehicle (ATV) riders must park at the junction with Trail 205, which is about one mile from the cabin, and hike the rest of the way. Motorcyclists can travel directly to the cabin in the allowed season.<br /><br /> Winter access is by snowmobile for 11 miles on the Big Sky Snowmobile Trail. Access by skis or snowshoes is difficult and not recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at an elevation of approximately 8,700 feet, among a stand of mixed conifers. Middle Fork Cabin Creek flows nearby. The surrounding meadow and forests give way to the peaks of the Madison Range.<br /><br />The Lee Metcalf Wilderness and Cabin Creek Wildlife Management Area are nearby.
