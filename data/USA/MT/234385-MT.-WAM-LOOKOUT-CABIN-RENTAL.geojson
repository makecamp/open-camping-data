    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mount Wam Lookout sits atop its namesake mountain at an elevation of 7,203 feet within the Ten Lakes Proposed Wilderness Area in Kootenai National Forest. The lookout was used regularly as an observation point for spotting forest fires between 1931 and 1951. It was restored in 1999.<br /><br /> The lookout is available from late June through September. Guests must hike 5 miles on 3 different trails to reach the lookout from the parking area. This rustic retreat offers few amenities, so guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout offers panoramic views of the Canadian Rockies to the north, the Galton Mountains to the west, the Whitefish Range to the south and Glacier National Parkto the east. From this vantage point, guests can enjoy beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and gaze out over starry skies on clear nights.<br /><br />Kootenai National Forest supports populations of deer, elk, moose, grizzly and black bears, wolves and mountain lions (<a href=http://fwp.mt.gov/recreation/safety/wildlife/bears/default.html>bear safety</a>). A variety of smaller mammals and birds can also be found.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Trails 77, 78 and 339 are used to access the lookout, and all offer challenging hikes.
