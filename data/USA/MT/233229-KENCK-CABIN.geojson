    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Guests can stay at Kenck Cabin for a rustic getaway in the fresh mountain air. The cabin was built in 1924 by a traveling doctor who arrived in the area in 1904 and spent his entire career along the Rocky Mountain Front. In 2003 the property was donated to the Forest Service by the Kenck Family Trust, and it has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Perched at an elevation of about 5,200 feet, the cabin sits near a series of flowing water, including Benchmark Creek, South Fork Sun River and Burned Creek. The surrounding area is a mixed conifer forest. <br /><br />Lewis and Clark National Forest boasts 1,600 miles of streams and a mix of small natural and man-made lakes. Native wildlife includes grizzly and black bears, white-tailed deer, bald eagles, lynx, bighorn sheep and grey wolves. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests can relax by the stream, watch for birds and hike the surrounding area. Photographers will particularly enjoy the views of Patrol Lookout found by the gate to the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Kenck is comprised of one room that sleeps six on a double bed, a futon that turns into a double bed and two cots. Heating and cooking is from two wood stoves, and firewood is provided. Cooking utensils and dishes are also provided. The cabin has a replica of an old monarch stove and classic wood dining chairs. <br /><br />No water is available. Renters should bring their own drinking water or be prepared to filter or boil stream water. A bucket and shovel is provided. An outhouse is available directly behind the cabin.  Items to bring include bedding, flashlights, food, small propane cylinders for the lanterns and a cooler.

The distance is about 30 miles, but due to rough, winding gravel roads, travel time can take an hour and a half to two hours.",

    "FacilityDirections": "From Augusta, head west Laura Street, which becomes Benchmark Road. Travel 13 miles to a &quot;Y&quot; intersection and turn left continuing on Benchmark Road. Drive 15 miles to the end of the road at South Fork Trailhead. Take the main trail that runs in front of the outhouse. From the main trail, take the first trail to the right, just after the &quot;Pack-In-Pack-Out&quot; sign. A small sign marks this trail leading to Kenck Cabin. The cabin is about a half-mile down the trail.<br /><br />Benchmark Road is not plowed in winter and can be snowed in as early as October. Snowmobiling is allowed on the road to the South Fork Trailhead if the road is no longer accessible to vehicles. However, snowmobiling is not allowed on trails beyond that point. Plan to hike, snowshoe or ski on main trail to cabin.",
