    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The original Big Creek Cabin was built in 1907 and it still stands on this site. The current cabin, a former guard station, was completed in 1925 and sits right next to theoriginal.<br /><br />Big Creek Cabin is the largest cabin in the Yellowstone District, a 28-by-40 log structure with five rooms and two porches. It offers rustic accommodations with limited amenities. Guests will need to bring much of their own gear and supplies.<br /><br /> The cabin is accessible by vehicle when theres no snow, however, four-wheel drive is strongly recommended. In the winter, skis or snowshoes are required to cover thehalf-mile to the cabin from the plowed road. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Big Creek Cabin is located in an area known as Paradise Valley, where the peaks of the Gallatin Range fracture the western sky and the Absarokas rise to the east.<br /><br /> The cabin sits in a flat clearing surrounded by spruce and fir trees at an elevation of 5,800 feet. Big Creek flows about 50 feet from the back porch. Bears, elk, deer and moose are frequently seen in the vicinity. <h4>Recreation:</h4>A trailhead is located near the cabin that leads to three different trails for hikers and equestrians. One of these trails heads into the Gallatin Range.<br /><br /> Good trout fishing is available in Big Creek. Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are popular winter pastimes.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is furnished with tables, chairs and enough beds with mattresses to accommodate 11 people (most are bunk beds). A propane lantern, wood cook stove and wood heat stove are also provided. Firewood is available, except in July and August. An axe with a splitting maul is available. A mop and bucket are provided for cleaning the cabin.<br /><br /> A corral is located across from the cabin, with room for six stock animals. A campfire ring and outhouse with vault toilet are just outside.<br /><br />  Water and electricity are not available. Guests will need to bring their own water supply. Propane fuel for the lantern is not provided, so it may be necessary to bring extra propane or battery-operated lanterns or flashlights. Garbage bags are needed to pack out trash.<br /><br />  For a comfortable stay, guests should bring a propane canister for the lantern, flashlight, bedding, cookware, dishes, utensils, newspaper, garbage bags, matches, toilet paper and first aid kit. Guests are expected to pack out all trash and clean the cabin and the stock corral (if used) before leaving.",
