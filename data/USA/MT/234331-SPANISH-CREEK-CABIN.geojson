    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Spanish Creek Cabin was constructed in 1934 and retains much of its rustic character from that time. The cabin is available year-round and offers an excellent base camp fora variety of summer and winter recreation opportunities. It is adjacent to a popular trailhead and a campground.<br /><br />Guests can drive to the cabin when there is no snow, but winter access is generally by snowshoes or skis for approximately 3.5 miles from the end of the plowed road. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at the base of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness, in a large meadow, at an elevation of 6,200 feet. Wildflowers add bursts of color around the cabin each summer. South Fork Spanish Creek flows nearby.<br /><br />The densely-forested peaks of the Madison Range surround the cabin. This area is home to grizzly bears, moose, elk, deer and bighorn sheep, as well as a variety of birdspecies. <h4>Recreation:</h4>A nearby trailhead provides access to a network of trails that head south into the Lee Metcalf Wilderness and west into non-wilderness areas. The trails can be used by hikers, equestrians, snowshoers and cross-country skiers. Mountain bikers can access the trails to the Spanish Peaks. Trails lead to Little Hell Roaring Creek, the north end of the Madison Range and the South Fork of Spanish Creek.<br /><br />This area also offers opportunities for fishing and hunting. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-story cabin has bunk beds and beds with mattresses to sleep up to four people. A wood cook stove is provided. In a kitchen area cleaning equipment is available.<br /><br />A campfire ring is located in front of the cabin.
