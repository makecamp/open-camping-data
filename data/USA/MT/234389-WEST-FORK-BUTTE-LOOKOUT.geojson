    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>West Fork Butte Lookout is an ideal place for guests to experience the mountains of southern Missoula from a unique vantage point. The facility provides near-360-degree views of the surrounding area. It is equipped with basic supplies and provides guests a base camp location by which to explore the area.<br /><br />Access to the lookout is variable during the spring and fall. Guests may have to hike, ski or snowmobile about 8 miles to the facility. Summer availability is relatively short, depending on the fire season. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The 14-by-14  lookout is situated on a rocky knob with spectacular views of the surrounding area, including the back of Lolo Peak, the opposing Bitterroot Mountains and the Lolo Creek drainage. It is close to the Montana-Idaho border and Lolo Pass.<br /><br />The surrounding forest contains a wide variety of trees, plants and wildlife. The area is home to mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk, moose, deer and grizzly and black bears. Both the bald and golden eagle reside in the forest, along with trumpeter swan, herons and dozens of varieties of ducks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking trails are available in the area. Visitors often bring cross-country skis or snowshoes for wintertime fun. Snowmobiles are often used to reach the lookout in the winter, but there are also many adjacent roads to explore while staying at the cabin.<br /><br />Fishing is available in nearby Lolo Creek. The area is popular for trout and mountain whitefish. The creek is a short hike from the lookout.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The lookout can sleep up to four people and is equipped with metal bunkbeds and mattress pads. It also has a table and chairs, a propane cook stove, basic cooking and eating utensils and some pots and pans, as well as a wood stove for heat. Firewood can be gathered in the area surrounding the facility, but is not always available. A vault toilet is provided.<br /><br />Guests should bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes. Bedding and towels, propane fuel canisters, flashlights, lanterns, matches, lighters, garbage bags, toilet paper and cleaning supplies are not supplied at the facility. The lookout will need to be cleaned before leaving.",
