    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Medicine Point Lookout is a historic tower located on Medicine Point, west of Sula. It has been restored to reflect a lookout of the 1940s, including the stove, furniture, dishes and other small touches. It offers a unique chance for visitors to camp on a mountain peak, near the scenic Bitterroot River in a rustic, old-time setting, while having the enjoyment of recreating on public lands. The tower provides spectacular views of the surrounding western Montana wilderness.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The tower is poised between the east and west forks of the Bitterroot River at an elevation of 8,409 feet. It offers beautiful views of the Bitterroot Mountains, as well as of a vista of the southern Bitterroot Valley to the east. On clear nights the lights of Hamilton can be seen from the tower.<br /><br />The Bitterroot forest is home to many species of wildlife, from mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bear, mountain lions and moose to many varieties of smaller animals and birds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>An extensive trail system exists in the area, including several loop trails for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding. Hitching racks are available at the base of the tower for equestrian campers needs. Road and trail conditions are unpredictable, as weather changes quickly in the area. For best results, consult the ranger district prior to travel.<br /><br />Aside from hiking and horseback riding, the area is replete with wildlife and offers scenic views. A lookout journal is kept inside, providing instructions of what to do in case of emergency or a storm. Danger from lightning is largely abated due to a lightning rod implanted at the structure.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 14-by-14 room at the top of the tower can accommodate up to four people. It is equipped with a bed platform for two, as well as a table and chairs, a propane fireplace for heat and a propane camp stove and lanterns. Propane for the fireplace is provided. Basic eating and cooking utensils are available and an outdoor vault toilet is provided.<br /><br />A 30-inch catwalk surrounds the towers single, glass-paneled room. Guests may need to saw their own firewood from down and dead material surrounding the lookout, and a bow saw and axe are provided. <br /><br />Guests will need to bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as propane fuel canisters for cooking and lighting. Guests are also responsible for their own bedding, towels, soap, toilet paper and garbage bags. The facility does not provide trash receptacles; all garbage should be carried out, and the tower should be cleaned by guests prior to leaving.<br /><br />The tower is accessed by a somewhat difficult 4-mile hike from the parking area. Snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles are not allowed on the trail, however, horses and other livestock are welcome. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.",
