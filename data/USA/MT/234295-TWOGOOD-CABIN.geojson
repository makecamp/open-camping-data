It was built in 1952 by Harry Twogood and Clifford Wetzsteon and was used throughout the 1970s as a range camp until it was opened to the public for recreation purposes.<br /><br />The Bitterroot forest is home to many species of wildlife, from mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bear, mountain lions, and moose to many varieties of smaller animals and birds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing is popular in the adjacent stream and anglers might catch a variety of trout. At least two other mountain creeks are available in the area. The Warm Springs Creek is a larger stream and provides excellent fishing for cutthroat and other trout. Visitors also enjoy wading in the cool water.<br /><br />A variety of hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding trails follow the creek. The large, rolling meadows are a winter elk range. When the snow melts, moose and deer may be spotted in the meadows. The 6-mile hike includes several creek crossings. <br /><br />Motorcycles are allowed on the trails but four-wheeled vehicles may not fit on the trails. In the winter, the trails are popular for cross country skiing and snowshoeing. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The one-room, 15-by-19 cabin can accommodate up to four people.
