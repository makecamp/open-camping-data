    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>White Earth Group Use Shelter is located at White Earth Campground, just east of the town of Winston, Montana, on Canyon Ferry Reservoir. In 1805, the Lewis and Clark expedition passed through this region. On July 22, 1805, Sacagawea recognizes the country and assures the men that the three forks of the Missouri were of no great distance. This news gave the expedition hope in the anticipation of soon reaching the headwaters of the Missouri River. <br /> <br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4>White Earth Campground sits along the banks of Canyon Ferry Reservoir in the open valley between the Big Belt and Elkhorn mountain ranges. <br /> <br /><h4>Recreation:</h4>Canyon Ferry Reservoir offers a wide range of year-round recreational opportunities. Water related activities include everything from swimming and fishing to sailing and motor-boating. Canoeists and kayakers explore the many quiet backwater bays. Jet skiers, windsurfers and water skiers skim the summer waves, while winter draws ice fishermen and ice skaters. <br /> <br /><h4>Facilities:</h4>White Earth Group Use Shelter is 30 X 44 shelter with electrical power. The shelter has 8 picnic tables, 5 campsites and an accessible vault toilet. White Earth Campground has 34 designated campsites, a boat ramp, and a parking area for boat trailers. During the peak summer months services include vault toilets, potable water, trash, recycling containers and campground hosts. <br /> <br /><h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>White Earth Group Use Shelter is located halfway between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. The city of Helena, MT, the states capital, is 25 miles away. For up-to-date events visit<a href=http://www.helenamt.com/>www.helenamt.com/</a> <br /> <br />",
