    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>McGillivray Campground has 33 total campsites and provides three opportunities for group rental camping. The group shelter will accommodate up to 200 people making it great for reunions and receptions. The two smaller group sites will accommodate up to 25 people each and are both located within the campground. <br /><br />Both group sites are ideal for campers to share an area with friends and family. The three sites all provide recreational opportunities such as hiking, fishing, boating and swimming.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The group site is located on the western shore of Lake Koocanusa in northwest Montana, at an elevation of about 2,520 feet. It is nestled in a heavily forested area with dense vegetation on the forest floor.<br /><br />The adjacent 46,500-acre reservoir has over 127 miles of shoreline and is formed by the 422 tall Libby Dam on the Kootenai River, which stretches about 90 miles and into Canada.<br /><br />Osprey often fish around Libby Dam at sunset, making for enjoyable viewing opportunities. Bald eagles can be seen hunting kokanee in the river and lake during the fall. A variety of wildlife also makes its home in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing, boating and swimming are popular activities. A swim beach, boat ramp and fish cleaning stations are located about a quarter-mile from the site, along a paved pathway. Fishing derbies are held multiple times each year and anglers can expect kokanee salmon, whitefish and a variety of trout. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The large, accessible shelter is equipped with a rock fireplace and multiple tables. Two Accessible vault toilets and drinking water are provided nearby. Two large cooking grills, horseshoe pits, path to beach area, fire ring and a 1-acre meadow adjoin the site. <br /><br />A large paved parking lot is available for large parties. The site is gated for security of rental parties and it is recommended that the gate is swung closed. Electrical hookups are available, however reservationists must supply a generator. Firewood is provided for the shelter. <br /><br />The two group sites within the campground provide parking for up to five RVs. Three tent pads, three picnic tables, fire ring, trail access and large cooking grill adjoin the sites. The sites are non-electric and firewood is not provided. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Kootenai River, below Libby Dam, is a blue ribbon fishery. Guided tours of the dam and powerhouse are offered at the visitor center throughout the summer season. <br /><br />Visitors enjoy driving the 100-mile loop around the reservoir. Several trails, including some that lead to scenic waterfalls, are located along the route.",
