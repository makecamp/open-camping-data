Indian Road Campground and Group Use Shelter is located just north of town of Townsend on Circleville Road.   Indian Creek was named by the first prospector on the creek, who had an Indian wife. Placer mining occurred here during the 1860s and 1870s. Near the Townsend turnoff for Indian Creek Road were the mining camps of Hog &rsquo;Em, Cheat &rsquo;Em, and Rob &rsquo;Em.  <br /> <br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4><b>Indian Road Group Use Shelter sits along the Missouri River at the south end of Canyon Ferry Reservoir between the Big Belt and Elkhorns Mountain ranges.</b> <br /> <br /><h4>Recreation:</h4>Canyon Ferry Reservoir offers a wide range of year-round recreational opportunities.
