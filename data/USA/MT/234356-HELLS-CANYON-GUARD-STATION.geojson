    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Hells Canyon Guard Station is a quaint log cabin located in the Highland Mountains of Montanas Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. It is most often used as a base camp by hunters and hikers. The area is replete with wildlife and provides access to scenic mountain views, as well as plentiful opportunities for recreation.<br /><br /> It was originally built in 1906 and used as a line cabin for ranchers before being donated to the Forest Service in 1910. The Forest Service has used the cabin as a guard station and now offers it for public enjoyment.<br /><br /> The cabin can be accessed by vehicle; however, during winter months, alternative resources may be required to reach the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is in an idyllic setting, with pristine nature all around. It is situated along Hells Canyon Creek in a lush meadow of sagebrush and tall grasses.<br /><br /> The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest is famous for its wide array of big game animals. Elk and deer are the most sought after by hunters on the forest and in the Hells Canyon area.
