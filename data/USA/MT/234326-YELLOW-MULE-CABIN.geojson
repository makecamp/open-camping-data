    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Yellow Mule Cabin was built in 1920 and was once used as a ranger station. This cabin is unique because it was constructed according to the builders preference instead of being built with a standard Forest Service design. It is eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br />The cabin provides a rustic, backcountry retreat year-round. A few basic amenities are provided, so guests should be prepared to bring most of the supplies and gear they need for an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />  This remote cabin is not accessible by car. Summer access is via off-road vehicle, motorcycle or hiking for 8 miles. Winter access is by snowmobile for 14 miles. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits between a meadow and a stand of mixed evergreens at an elevation of approximately 8,650 feet. Wildflowers bloom across the meadow in the summer and a thick layer of pristine snow blankets the area in winter. The jagged, glaciated peaks of the Madison Mountain Range stretch out into the distance.<br /><br />Wildlife in this area includes grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, deer, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and the Canada lynx. Birders may see a wide variety of bird species.    <h4>Recreation:</h4>This cabin is popular with snowmobilers because of its proximity to the Buck Creek Ridge Trail, which offers a 1,000 foot elevation gain. Hikers, mountain bikers andoff-road vehicle riders enjoy this trail in the summer.<br /><br /> Snowmobilers and cross-country skiers can also access McAtee Basin. Hunting in designated areas is another popular pastime.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 12 x 14 single-room cabin can sleep up to three people and comes with three cots. A wood stove is provided for heat. Basic cookware, utensils, a propane lantern and a dining table with chairs are available. An outhouse with a vault toilet is located just outside.<br /><br />Water, electricity, cooking facilities and firewood are not provided. Guests must bring their own water supply and trash bags to pack out trash, as well as bedding, matches, first aid supplies, extra toilet paper and battery-operated lanterns or flashlights.",
