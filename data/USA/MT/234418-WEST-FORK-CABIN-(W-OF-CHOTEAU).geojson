    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>West Fork Cabin is a rustic Forest Service Guard Station located 39 miles northwest of Choteau, Montana, on the Rocky Mountain Front Range.  The cabin is a stone&rsquo;s throw from the North Fork Teton River and about 3.5 miles beyond Teton Pass Ski Resort.  Open year-round, the cabin provides access to a wide range of summer and winter recreation activities such as hiking, fishing, horseback riding, cross country skiing and snowshoeing.   <br /><br />This rustic cabin is accessible via paved county road, then gravel Forest Service road.  During the winter months when the ski area is operating, the Forest Service gravel road is plowed to the ski area.  Beyond that point, guests will need to ski, showshoe or snowmobile to travel the last 3.5 miles to the cabin.  The cabin is available year-round for rental, seven days a week.  Contact the Ranger District for current road conditions.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Set in the Rocky Mountain Front Range, the cabin sits in the valley of the North Fork Teton River near Mount Werner and Mount Wright. <br /><br />Lewis and Clark National Forest boasts 1,600 miles of streams and several small natural and man-made lakes. Native wildlife includes grizzly and black bears, white-tailed deer, bald eagles, lynx, bighorn sheep and grey wolves. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Recreation opportunities include hiking, horseback riding, fishing, snowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing.  Downhill skiing is offered at the ski resort located about 3.5 miles from the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The single-room cabin is divided into a kitchen and dining area plus a sleeping area.  It sleeps six adults with two sets of bunk beds and two folding cots.  A vault toilet is located outside.<br /><br />The cabin is heated by propane, and a limited amount of firewood is provided for the wood stove.  A propane cook stove is also included.  Although a ramp leads into the cabin and outhouse, the interior is not designed to meet accessibility standards. <br /><br />No electricity or refrigerator is available so guests will need to bring coolers.  The area is covered by a special food storage regulation from March 1 through December 15 designed to minimize bear/human conflicts.  All food must be stored in bear resistant containers or inside the cabin or a hard-sided vehicle when unattended.  Water is available at a hand pump outside the cabin.  Recommended items to bring include sleeping bags, food, toilet paper, a lantern, towels, matches and first aid kit. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Food, fuel and other supplies are available in Choteau, 39 miles from the cabin.",
