    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Challenge Cabin is available during the winter and is located about 60 miles southeast of Hungry Horse, in northwestern Montana. It provides a primitive escape for visitors who enjoy winter recreation. The cozy shelter awards visitors with beautiful mountain views, peaceful sounds of nature and virgin, white snow for great photography and snow play.<br /><br />Access to the cabin involves an 8-mile trek by hiking, skiing, snowshoeing or snowmobiling. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in a meadow surrounded by a stand of Douglas fir and pine trees, near Challenge Creek. The Hungry Horse Ranger District is bordered on the east by the Middle Fork of the Flathead River and Glacier National Park. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Cross country skiing, snowmobiling and snowshoeing are popular activities enjoyed by visitors to the area. Reaching the cabin on the 8-mile access trail is part of the snow sport fun. Visitors might also catch a glimpse of any number of wildlife that lives in the area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can sleep up to five guests. It is equipped with a propane cook stove, lights, and a wood stove. Furnishings include a table and chairs, a bunk bed and a small loft where additional people can roll out sleeping bags.
