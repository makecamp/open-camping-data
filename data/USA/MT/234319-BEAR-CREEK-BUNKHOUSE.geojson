Situated on the Bear Creek, the cabin offers a scenic location to enjoy nature. <br /><br />The bunkhouse is used as an administrative site in the summer and fall months, but is open to the public between December and April. During the winter months, in addition to hunting, visitors can enjoy cross country skiing and snowshoeing, as well as hiking and horseback riding on nearby trails.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by vehicle, however, a portion of the road may be muddy or snow-covered, as it is not plowed. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities, including water.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The facility is located at the edge of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness, at the foot of the Madison Range. The bunkhouse is situated at an elevation of 6,250 feet, amid open meadows that are surrounded by mature hardwoods and other trees.<br /><br />Bear Creek runs near the bunkhouse and nearby cabin, and the Bear Creek Wildlife Management Area lies immediately to the north. The area is home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, mule deer, black bears and grizzly bears, mountain grouse, and other species (learn more about bear safety).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Big game hunting is an activity enjoyed by visitors to the bunkhouse.
