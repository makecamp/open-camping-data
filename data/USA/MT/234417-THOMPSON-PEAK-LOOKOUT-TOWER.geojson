    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Thompson Peak Lookout provides great views of the Clark Fork Valley, the town of Superior, the Idaho state line and, of course, the big sky of Montana. It is close enough to Superior to allow for easy access, but remote enough to provide the quiet and solitude expected at a lookout. The modernized tower provides amenities not typical to a lookout, making it a desirable place to stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout is located on the third floor of a multiple story building that is used as a radio and cellular tower. Equipment is located on other floors of the building. It is constructed out of concrete blocks with an enclosed stairway, making it more suitable for children.<br /><br />The 2 million-acre Lolo National Forest includes four wilderness areas and a wide variety of trees, plants and wildlife. The area is home to mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk, moose, deer and grizzly and black bears. Both the bald and golden eagle reside in the forest, along with trumpeter swan, herons and dozens of varieties of duck.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A variety of trails exist in the area, allowing visitors a chance to explore the surrounding forest. Wildlife spotting is also a popular activity. Most of all, visitors come to the tower to relax and enjoy the scenery.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The one-room rental cabin is equipped with 1 twin bed/mattress pads. Sleeps up to four people. The facility has electricity and cell phone service, as well as an electric stove, heater, microwave and small refrigerator. Some basic eating and cooking utensils are supplied, as well as pots and pans, but drinking water is not available. An outhouse with a vault toilet is provided.<br /><br />Guests will need to bring water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as bedding, towels, soap, garbage bags and toilet paper. Guests will need to clean the cabin before leaving. Some basic cleaning equipment and supplies are provided. <br /><br />The facility can be accessed by vehicle on available dates between May 27 and Oct. 13. It is closed to the public during the remainder of the year. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.",
