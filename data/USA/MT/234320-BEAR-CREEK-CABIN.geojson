The cabin is situated at an elevation of 6,250 feet, amid open meadows that are surrounded by mature hardwoods and other trees.<br /><br />Bear Creek runs near the cabin and nearby bunkhouse, and the Bear Creek Wildlife Management Area lies immediately to the north. The area is home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, mule deer, black bears and grizzly bears, mountain grouse, and other species (learn more about bear safety).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Big game hunting is an activity enjoyed by visitors to the cabin. In addition, there are a variety of hiking and horseback riding trails in the area.
