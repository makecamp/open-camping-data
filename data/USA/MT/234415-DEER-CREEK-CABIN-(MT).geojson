    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Todd Family began building Deer Creek Cabin in 1953 and finished it in 1960. They used it as a retreat while they grazed cattle on federal lands in the summer and hunted in the fall. The cabin has survived two forest fires. Gallatin National Forest assumed ownership of the cabin in 1993.<br /><br />The cabin is open year-round, but access is challenging. There are two routes to the cabin that can be used by equestrians and hikers in the summer or by snowshoers and skiers in the winter. These 4- to 5-mile routes ford creeks many times, with creek depths varying from 6 inches to several feet.<br /><br />Some basic conveniences are provided, but guests will need to bring several of their own amenities to ensure a comfortable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>This remote location provides habitat for a variety of wildlife, including bear, moose, antelope, elk and deer. Many species of birds also inhabit the area.<br /><br />Blackened trees from a 2006 forest fire still line the nearby hillsides.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Lower Deer Creek Trail is available for hiking and equestrian use and follows Deer Creek in a north-south direction, joining trails that break off and head west into the foothills of the Beartooth range. Experienced cross-country skiers and snowshoers will find a challenging winter landscape.<br /><br />   Anglers can fish for brook trout and brown trout in the nearby creek. The area offers good big game and bird hunting opportunities in the fall. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The single-room cabin has a cook stove and a wood heating stove. It can sleep up to four people on a provided double bed and set of bunk beds with mattresses. Other amenities include basic cooking and eating supplies, a table with chairs, some cleaning gear, firewood (for the wood stove only), a propane cook stove, propane-fueled lantern, axe, bucket and shovel. <br /><br />A campfire ring and outhouse with pit toilet are located outside the cabin. Livestock may be kept at the available adjacent corral and in partially fenced pasture.<br /><br /> No water or electricity is provided. Guests must bring their own drinking water or treat water taken from the creek. A 16.4-ounce propane cylinder, which is not supplied, is required to operate the cook stove.<br /><br />Items such as battery-powered flashlights or lanterns, bedding, matches, extra toilet paper and dish soap are not provided.",
