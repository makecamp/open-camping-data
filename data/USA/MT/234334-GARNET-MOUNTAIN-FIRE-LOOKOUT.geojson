    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Garnet Mountain Fire Lookout sits on the apex of Garnet Mountain, at an elevation of 8,245 feet. The lookout provides a panoramic view of the surrounding peaks and valleys. Highlights include the Spanish Peaks to the west, the Gallatin Range to the south, the Hyalite Ridge to the east and the Gallatin River Valley to the north.<br /><br />  The structure can be accessed by hiking, horseback or off-road vehicles on the Garnet Mountain Lookout Trail in the summer.

The current structure was built in 1962. The lookout is available for reservation year-round. It is an excellent vantage point for watching sunrises and sunsets, or for gazing at the stars on a clear night.<br /><br />  Grizzly bears are extremely common in this area, and gray wolves, mountain lions, deer, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and the Canada lynx also make their home here. Awide variety of bird species can also be seen. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers, mountain bikers and off-road vehicle riders can access the same trail used to get to the lookout. Snowy conditions offer abundant opportunities for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.<br /><br />Big game hunting for bear, elk or moose is a popular autumn pastime around Garnet Mountain.   <h4>Facilities:</h4>The lookout can sleep up to four people on provided bunk beds with mattresses.
