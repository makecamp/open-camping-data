    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Hogback Homestead is a fully furnished log cabin that sits on approximately five acres along Hogback Creek in western Montana. It provides access to a variety of recreational activities, including the Rock Creek, as well as exceptional scenery. The cabin is on a Forest Service work site, where fire crews occasionally assemble, but with plenty of space to spread out, visitors will hardly know theyre there.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located near the scenic Hogback Creek, in the rugged Sapphire Mountains, at an elevation of 4,500 feet. It was built in 1917 as a permanent home for Forest Service employees. In the early 1990s the Missoula Ranger District, along with many dedicated volunteers, restored the Hogback Homestead to its original historic condition, providing renters an opportunity to experience the setting and lifestyle of the early 1900s.<br /><br />The Sapphire Mountains contain large stands of Douglas fir and lodgepole pine forests and are home to a variety of wildlife, including bighorn sheep, mountain goats, elk, moose, deer and grizzly and black bears. Both the bald and golden eagle reside in the forest, along with trumpeter swan, herons and 30 varieties of ducks. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The area is popular for big game hunting in designated areas and wildlife viewing. Visitors also enjoy fishing in Rock Creek. The mountain stream is known for its exceptional trout fishing.<br /><br />A variety of hiking trails are accessible, including the Hogback Ridge Trail, which ascends to the nearby peak. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing are excellent winter activities on the nearby trails.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-story cabin has three bedrooms and can sleep up to eight people. The kitchen, living room/dining room, and a single bedroom with a double bed are located on the first floor. Two bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with two bunk beds, are located on the second floor. The first floor is wheelchair accessible.<br /><br />The cabin is heated with a wood stove and is equipped with propane lights and a propane range cook stove. The rental is outfitted with period furniture including a large bench-style dining table, kitchen table, chairs, couches, wardrobe and dressers. Cleaning supplies, kitchen utensils and cookware may be available; however renters are encouraged to bring their own.<br /><br />Water is available intermittently at the hand pump located behind the homestead, although it is not guaranteed. An accessible vault toilet is also provided outside, behind the cabin.<br /><br />Guests should bring water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes, as well as propane fuel for cooking and lighting. Bedding, pillows, towels, food, matches, flashlights, toilet paper and garbage bags are not provided. Guests are responsible for cleaning the cabin prior to their departure.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible by vehicle, except during parts of the winter. Depending on conditions, guests may need to hike, ski or snowmobile up to a half-mile to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.",

    "FacilityDirections": "From Missoula, Montana, travel east on Interstate 90 for about 20 miles to exit 126. Drive south on Rock Creek Road for about 29 miles. Rock Creek Road is a hardened surface for 12 miles and the remainder is a gravel, single-lane road, with intermittent pull-outs. It is not suitable for RVs or trailers, due to blind turns, steep grades and a narrow width. <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lolo/maps-pubs/?cid=fsm9_021428>Maps</a> are available online or for purchase by calling the Missoula Ranger District.<br /><br />During winter, take the Drummond exit 153 on Interstate 90 and follow Scenic Highway 1 south to Philipsburg. One mile north of Philipsburg, turn west on State Road 348. Travel 13 miles west, cross Rock Creek and turn north onto Rock Creek Road. Continue 12 miles to the homestead. Winter access is plowed within 4 miles of the cabin. A four-wheel drive vehicle equipped with chains is recommended. Travelers may also want to bring an alternate form of transportation (ski, snowshoe or snowmobile) to complete the route.",
