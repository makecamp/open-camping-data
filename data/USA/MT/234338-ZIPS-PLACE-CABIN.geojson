    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Zips Place Cabin is located 48 miles east of Hungry Horse, in northwestern Montana. It provides a beautiful setting on property that was originally a homestead granted in 1937. In 1945 the land was bought by the Kimmet family of Cut Bank, and in 1954 the family constructed the cabin that resides there today. Visitors enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, biking, winter sports and viewing wildlife.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by vehicle during the summer months. During the winter months or when the road conditions are impassable, guests must park at the designated parking area and hike, snowmobile, ski, or snowshoe approximately one mile to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin entrance faces a large grassy lawn area. The rear backs up to a stand of lodgepole pine and Douglas fir trees. A small stream runs behind the cabin. <br /><br />The Hungry Horse Ranger District is bordered on the east by the Middle Fork of the Flathead River and Glacier National Park. It also covers part of the 286,700-acre Great Bear Wilderness.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking and mountain biking are popular activities in warmer months. Cross country skiing, snowmobiling and snow shoeing entertain visitors in winter.
