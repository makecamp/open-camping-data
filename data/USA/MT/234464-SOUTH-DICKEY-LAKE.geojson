In the spring and early summer, the sound of the loon can often be heard from the beach.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The lake provides ample opportunity for boating, fishing, swimming and water skiing. Anglers can expect a catch of kokanee salmon, kamloop and rainbow trout. A grassy lawn gently slopes down to the lake. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The reservable group picnic area can accommodate up to 50 people and is equipped with two tables and campfire rings with grills. Accessible vault toilets and potable drinking water are also provided. The swimming beach is available for use, but is open to the public as well.
