It is equipped with modern features, including a full-service kitchen and bathrooms, and provides guests with access to a variety of activities. <br /><br />The cabin sits within an open meadow surrounded by an evergreen forest, providing beautiful scenery during any season.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The 3,200-foot elevation site has multiple structures and has previously been used as a ranger station for the old Cabinet National Forest, which was divided by the Forest Service in 1954. The original log cabin is on-site and was constructed in 1911. <br /><br />While there are several buildings at Bend, the only one available for recreation rental use is the combined bunkhouse and cookhouse building. It was built in 1923 to house Forest Service work crews and rangers working in the area and was remodeled in 1984.<br /><br />The 2 million-acre forest includes four wilderness areas and a wide variety of trees, plants and wildlife. The area is home to mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk, moose, deer and grizzly and black bears.
