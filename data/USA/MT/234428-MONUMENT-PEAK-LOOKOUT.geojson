    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Monument Peak Lookout offers guests an impressive yet rustic room with a view. The lookout, built in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is perched atop Monument Peak, boasting spectacular 360 degree views of the Little Belt Mountains. The lookout was once used to spot forest fires but was left unused since the 1970s. In 1999, the lookout was removed from its 50 foot pole, restored and placed on a short, solid foundation for public rental use. <br /><br />In winter, access is by snowmobiles, cross country skis or snowshoes only. In summer, a high clearance vehicle is recommended, as the 4 miles of road leading up to the cabin are rough. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout sits at 7,395 feet in elevation, offering views of Monument Ridge and Strawberry Ridge. The surrounding region is a dense coniferous forest with fir, spruce and pine trees. <br /><br />Lewis and Clark National Forest has many miles of streams and fishing opportunities. Native wildlife includes black bears, white-tailed deer, bald eagles, mountain lions and other species.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Small and big game hunting is popular in the area. Hiking and wildlife viewing are also enjoyed. Winter activities include cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The rustic lookout has two beds with mattresses, two propane lanterns, a table and chairs and a propane cooking stove. Pots, pans, dishes and utensils are included. A vault toilet is about 100 feet from the structure. <br /><br />No water, electricity or plumbing is available. Recommended items to bring include drinking water, bedding, flashlights, food, small propane canisters, firewood, matches and a cooler. <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lcnf/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=61588&amp;actid=101>Click here</a>) for more cabin details.",
