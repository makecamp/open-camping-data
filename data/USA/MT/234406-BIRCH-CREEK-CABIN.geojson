    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Birch Creek Cabin is a cozy, log cabin with electricity and running water. It provides access to a variety of trails used for hiking during the summer and fall and for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing during winter months. The cabin is conveniently located near a mountain creek and is surrounded by scenic, forested mountains.<br /><br />Guests can typically access the cabin by vehicle, depending on conditions. The road leading to the cabin is gravel and the final quarter-mile may be covered with snow during the winter, requiring skis or snowmobile to complete the route. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits within a historic Civilian Conservation Corps work camp at the confluence of Birch Creek and Thief Creek. It is situated on the eastern slopes of the Pioneer Mountains in southwestern Montana, and was used as a forest ranger station as early as 1908. A forested picnic area is nearby.<br /><br />An abundance of wildlife lives in the area, including elk, moose, pine marten, wolverine, northern goshawk and black bear.<h4>Recreation:</h4>An extensive network of hiking trails exists on the surrounding peaks and valleys. Some lead to alpine lakes, which offer quality mountain fishing. Grayling, cutthroat trout, brook trout and rainbow trout can all be found in the mountain waters.<br /><br />There are two popular cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails adjacent to the cabin. The Birch Creek Loop and the May Lake Ski Trail both traverse through the area. Old mining roads are plentiful in the area, providing excellent opportunities for exploration on foot, bike or horseback.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-room log cabin is equipped with bunkbeds and mattress pads that will sleep up to four people. A separate kitchen has a table and chairs, an electric cook stove, pots and pans and basic eating and cooking utensils. <br /><br />A wood stove is available inside the cabin for heat and firewood is provided. An outhouse with a vault toilet is available outside the cabin. Drinking water is provided, but is not available year-round.<br /><br />Guests will need to bring their own bedding, including blankets and pillows, as well as  matches, food, toilet paper, garbage bags and other necessities. Wood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed. Those staying at the cabin during the winter months will need to bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes.<br /><br />Guests are asked to be conservative with wood and propane fuel used to light the cabin, as well as clean the cabin and carry out all trash upon departure.",
