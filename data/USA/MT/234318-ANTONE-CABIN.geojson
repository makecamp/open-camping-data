    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Antone Cabin sits in a beautiful open meadow, at the edge of a thick forest, providing visitors with a unique camping experience in the mountains of southwestern Montana. The cabin opens for use in mid-summer and stays open through March, as it is most popular during hunting season.<br /><br />In addition to hunting access, the facility provides ample opportunities for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding, as well as winter sports, such as snowmobiling and cross country skiing.<br /><br />During most winter months, the cabin can be accessed by snowmobile, depending on conditions. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities to really enjoy their stay at Antone Cabin.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The historic log cabin is located along the grassy foothills at the southern end of the Snowcrest Range, at an elevation of 8,100 feet. Together with the nearby Gravelly Range, the area is one of Montanas most popular hunting grounds.<br /><br />The two mountain ranges are home to nearly 10,000 elk and a growing population of grizzly bears (learn more about bear safety). Moose are also frequent visitors to the meadow where the cabin lies.<br /><br />The large horse pasture adjacent to the cabin is for administrative use only. The public may rent the small horse corral that is next to the trailhead for an additional fee. No livestock is permitted inside the small fenced area immediately around the cabin. <h4>Recreation:</h4>A variety of hiking, backpacking and horseback riding trails extend into the Snowcrest Range, including the Snowcrest Trail, which covers the entire range, providing panoramic views. The 40-mile trail can serve as the means for a hearty horseback adventure, a lengthy backpacking trip, or make for several day trips into the wilderness.<br /><br />The nearby Blacktail Deer Creek, and other seasonal mountain streams, offer access to freshwater fishing. Anglers can enjoy a possible catch of brook trout, among other species. <br /><br />Cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling on the adjacent open meadow and along forest trails, are popular activities enjoyed by visitors during long winter months.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a small, primitive, one-room log cabin, equipped with bunk beds that sleep up to two people, a table and chairs. The cabin has a loft, but it is not available for public use, due to safety regulations. <br /><br />Also inside the cabin is a propane stove with an oven, a wood stove for heat, a shelf and cupboard space, cooking pots, eating utensils, a broom and dust pan, bucket, shovel, axe and cleaning supplies. Foam pads are supplied on the beds.<br /><br />Outside there is a toilet approximately 40 feet southeast of the cabin. Two propane lights are supplied by a large propane tank outside and firewood is stacked near the outside fence on the porch, however the supply cannot be guaranteed.<br /><br />Guests must bring their own water. The spring just south of the cabin may have sufficient water for cleaning, but is unreliable. Sleeping bags and blankets are not supplied, and users will also need to bring their own matches, food, toilet paper and garbage bags. Garbage and cleaning services are not provided.",
