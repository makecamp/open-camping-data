    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Moose Lake Cabin is located in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest in southwestern Montana. The historic cabin, which was built in 1917 for use as a work cabin, offers visitors access to the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness Area, which covers almost 250 square miles of mountain ranges.<br /><br /> Many lakes and streams provide ample access to world famous trout fishing and the area also boasts miles of trails for hiking, backpacking and horseback riding.<br /><br />The site can typically be accessed by vehicle, depending on conditions. Excessive snowfall may require visitors to walk, ski or snowshoe about a quarter mile from the main road to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located on the Middle Fork of Rock Creek near the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness. It sits at the edge of an open meadow, surrounded by evergreens and towering peaks.<br /><br /> The area is known for its high, rugged and beautiful mountain scenery, as well as the variety of wildlife that makes its home there, including elk, moose, deer, mountain lions and bears (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/bdnf/learning/safety-ethics/?cid=FSM9_003342>learn more about bear safety</a>).<br /><br /><h4>Recreation:</h4>Big game hunting is the primary draw for visitors to the cabin and surrounding wilderness. Participants must have Montana licenses to hunt or fish, and must only huntin designated areas. Fishing for brook and cutthroat trout is excellent in the area, which is widely known for its trout-filled mountain streams. <br /><br />Across nearby Moose Lake, hiking and horseback riding trails lead into the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness. Other trailheads are also available in the area. Visitors also enjoy snowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing in the area during the winter. Various weather conditions can increase avalanche danger in the area; visitors are encouraged to carry proper backcountry equipment, including a beacon, shovel and probe while recreating.<br /><br />There is a fenced pasture for horses at the cabin but you must check the fence for damage before using it. Horses are not allowed in the wilderness area until July 1st each year. As a reminder, pelletized or certified weed seed free feed and straw is required in all National Forests in Montana; please plan accordingly.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The primitive, one-room cabin is equipped with two sets of bunk beds with mattress pads that can sleep up to four people. It has a table and chairs, basic cooking utensils and a few cooking pots. Some cleaning supplies and equipment are also provided.<br /><br />There is a wood stove for heat. Firewood is provided but cannot be guaranteed.  An outhouse with a vault toilet is nearby. A hand pump for drinking water, picnic table and fire pit are also outside. Accessible pit toilet and drinking water are available at the cabin except in the winter.<br /><br />Guests will need to bring their own sleeping bags and pillows, as well as matches, food, toilet paper and garbage bags. There is limited cell phone service available in the area. Guests are asked to replenish the supply of split wood and kindling, pack out all trash and food, and clean the cabin prior to leaving.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Skalkaho Highway (Highway 38) leads into the Sapphire Mountains along a primitive and once widely used Native American trail. The scenic drive, which is closed during winter, was built to provide access between mining areas and agricultural communities in the Bitterroot Valley. About 30 miles from the cabin, the road leads to Skalkaho Falls in the neighboring Bitterroot National Forest.",
