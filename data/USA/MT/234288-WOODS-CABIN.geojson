    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Woods Cabin offers a unique chance to camp in the forest, in a rustic, old-time setting, while enjoying all the summer and winter activities that are available from the shore of scenic Lake Como. <br /><br />The cabin provides a comfortable experience and spectacular views, with its large windows and decks overlooking the lake and nearby mountain peaks. It also provides access to the lake and a nearby beach and gives visitors access to a myriad of trails and open spaces. <br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT WINTER RENTAL INFORMATION: <br /><br />Woods Cabin is available for rent in the winter and provides a great basecamp for numerous outdoor winter recreation activities.  To ensure your stay is enjoyable, there are a few things to note when renting the cabin during the winter. The road to the cabin is NOT maintained during the winter months, so depending on weather conditions, you may or may not be able to drive to the Woods Cabin parking lot. The gate is closed on the access road to Woods Cabin for public safety so that visitors do not drive down to the cabin and get stuck or slide into the cabin. The county road, however, to the boat launch (located on the south side of Lake Como) is maintained. Visitors can park at the boat launch and walk, ski, or snowshoe across the dam and up to Woods Cabin, which is approximately &frac34; mile. Be prepared to haul your gear into the cabin via sled or backpacks. There is no drinking water available this time of year, so please bring your own drinking water. Firewood is provided at the cabin but it may need to be split. A splitting maul is also provided. Please be aware of rapidly changing weather conditions and always use caution and be prepared when recreating in winter conditions.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located along the north shore of 913-acre Lake Como in the central Bitterroot Mountains of western Montana. It is situated at an elevation of 4,245 feet and is primarily used for meetings, workshops and retreats, as it can accommodate a larger group of people. The cabin is more than 60 years old and accommodations are rustic. <br /><br />A variety of wildlife and birds can be seen from the cabin and its surroundings. Osprey, bald eagles, deer, moose, elk and bears make their home in the area (learn about <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/bitterroot/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Boating, fishing, swimming and other water sports are popular on Lake Como. Anglers might see rainbow and cutthroat trout, as well as kokanee salmon, among other alpine species. A boat ramp and parking area are available at the south side of the lake. A large, sandy beach is available to visitors at the lake. <br /><br />To the west of the cabin, a short walk will take visitors to a trailhead that begins a 7-mile loop trail around Lake Como. The Lake Como National Recreation Loop Trail is suitable for hiking, mountain biking and accessing the lake for swimming or picnics. The first quarter-mile of the trail is wheelchair accessible and the trail also crosses Rock Creek at one point. <br /><br />Approximately 3 miles from the cabin, at the west end of the lake, is a magnificent waterfall that cascades over fern-covered rock cliffs. A trail continues from the waterfall, or heads west up Rock Creek, into the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area. <br /><br />Winter activities include groomed cross-country ski trails located on the south side of Lake Como, beginning at the boat launch parking area. Other outdoor activities in the area include ice fishing on Lake Como and snowshoeing around the lake. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The rustic cabin has three bedrooms, a living area and a kitchen. It has beds that can accommodate up to 12 people (double bunk beds with mattresses). The main living area offers a table and chairs, and both a fireplace and two wood stoves for heating... <br /><br />The cabin was built in 1928 and was renovated in 2011. Please be awar",
