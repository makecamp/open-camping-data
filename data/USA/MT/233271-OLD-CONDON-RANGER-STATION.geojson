    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Old Condon Ranger Station is open year-round, providing access to great recreation opportunities in every season. Visitors to the area enjoy fishing in the nearby Swan River, as well as hiking and exploring areas surrounding the cabin. Varieties of birds and wildlife make their home in the area.<br /><br />The cabin provides modern amenities and can be reached by vehicle. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring some of their own supplies to ensure a comfortable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is nestled in Swan Valley just west of the Bob Marshall Wilderness. It sits about five miles east of the Swan River. From the front porch, guests can see views of the Mission Mountains across an open field. Behind the cabin is a stand of towering mixed pine trees and Simpson Creek flows nearby.  <br /><br />Part of a historic Forest Service compound, the rangers residence was constructed in the early 1920s and later restored for public use. Historically, the site was used year round to operate the Condon Ranger District, which has been renamed as the Swan Lake Ranger District. The work center was relocated in the 1960s, but some structures remain to remind visitors of the old Forest Service days. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests at the house enjoy fishing in the nearby creek and river, as well as viewing wildlife. The facility affords scenic views of the Mission Mountains. <br /><br />A variety of trails are available nearby for hiking and backpacking. The same trails serve as popular areas for cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-story cabin greets guests with a screened porch and a green painted front door. It has a living and dining room with a wood stove and a gas furnace, as well as electricity and a full kitchen. The kitchen includes a refrigerator with freezer and a modern gas range and oven. Cabinets are stocked with basic cookware, plates, cups, bowls and utensils. <br /><br />Upstairs are three bedrooms with a mix of two double and four single beds. The couch in the living room also folds flat for use as a bed. Old Condon can comfortably sleep up to eight people. An indoor bathroom features running water and a flush toilet.<br /><br />Guests should bring bedding, food and personal toiletries.
