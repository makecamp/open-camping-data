    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Trail Creek Cabin, built in 1924, was the original ranger station for the Bozeman Ranger District. It is available from June through March, offering guests the chance to enjoy summer or winter recreation.<br /><br />The cabin is located in a remote area that is not accessible by car. Guests must travel on foot, horseback, off-road vehicle or mountain bike, or, in winter, on skis, snowshoes or snowmobile to reach the cabin. The best route for arriving on foot or horseback is about 2 miles, while off-road vehicles and snowmobiles have a 5-mile route.<br /><br /> Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located in the foothills of the Gallatin Mountains at an elevation of 6,200 feet. It is situated on the edge of a meadow in front of a stand of lodgepolepine. The front porch of the cabin offers views of the meadow with the mountain peaks beyond. A small creek flows behind the cabin.<br /><br />Guests may catch a glimpse of a bear, moose, elk or deer. Several bird species can also be spotted.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin is ideally located along a trail system that connects the Livingston and Bozeman forest districts. A hiking and equestrian trail at the end of Goose Creek Road leads to several alpine lakes. Snowy conditions provide ample opportunities to snowshoers and cross-country skiers.<br /><br />Area trails are closed to off-road vehicles, dirt bikes and other motorized vehicles, but it is possible for four-wheeler and dirt bike riders to use the old roads in the vicinity. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin has bunk beds with mattresses to accommodate up to four people. A wood stove is available to heat the cabin. Other amenities include a table with chairs, propane lantern, shovel, bucket, mop and broom. The cabin is stocked with firewood from September through June, as well as an axe and splitting maul.<br /><br />A campfire ring and an outhouse with vault toilet are located outside. A horse corral is provided for four animals, and guests who use it must clean it before leaving. Feed must be weed seed free, and out of state horses must have a current Coggins test. Water for the horses can be taken from the creek behind the cabin.<br /><br />The cabin does not offer electricity or water. Guests must bring their own drinking water, food, cooking gear and propane canisters for the lantern, as well as their own bedding, dishes, utensils, matches, newspaper, flashlights, garbage bags, extra toilet paper, a first aid kit and dish soap, among other necessities. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash removed prior to leaving.",
