    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Lake Inez Campground Group Site is in a beautiful part of the Lake Seeley Ranger District of Montanas Lolo National Forest. Located next to a beautiful mountain lake, the campsite is a popular place for visitors to enjoy a variety of water-related recreation opportunities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The small campground sits along the eastern shore of 314-acre Lake Inez. A dense conifer forest limits the visibility of the lake, but affords privacy between campsites. Plentiful shrubs and undergrowth give the 4,100-foot elevation campground beautiful colors during the fall.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Lake Inez is a popular spot for boating, jet skiing and fishing; however, the available boat ramp is not very developed. Non-motorized boating and swimming are also available and usually done away from high traffic watercraft use. Anglers can expect to see a variety of fish, from salmon to suckers, to pike, trout and perch.<br /><br />The campground is a short distance from the Clearwater River Canoe Trail, which offers prime birding and wildlife viewing opportunities in a scenic setting. The water trail is popular with canoeists and kayakers as it stretches 3.5 miles, or a couple of hours, down the river.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The group site is the only campsite available for reservations at the campground. Individual sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The site is equipped with tables and campfire rings with grills. Accessible vault toilets are provided, however drinking water and trash collection are not provided. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Seeley Lake, Montana, is the closest town and is about a 10-minute drive from the campground. A variety of services are offered there.",
