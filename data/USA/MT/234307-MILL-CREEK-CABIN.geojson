    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mill Creek Cabin was built in 1927 as a temporary lodging for traveling Forest Service personnel. <br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by vehicle year-round, though a four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety. This cabin offers rustic accommodations with limited amenities, so guests need to bring most of their own supplies and gear for a comfortable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Mill Creek Cabin is tucked into the Absaroka Mountains, at an elevation of 5,750 feet. The cabin sits at the edge of a meadow in front of a stand of evergreens. The back porch overlooks bubbling Mill Creek, a tributary of the Yellowstone River.<br /><br />Deer, elk and black bears are sometimes visitors to this area. Bird species that inhabit this area include bald eagles, owls, jays, western meadowlarks and mountain bluebirds.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers and equestrians can access trailheads that lead into the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. Anglers can fish for Yellowstone cutthroat trout in Mill Creek. Huckleberry-picking is a popular pastime when theyre in season.<br /><br />Winter recreation includes cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling on the Mill Creek Snowmobile Trail. The cabin also offers easy access to the Snowbank and and Passage Creek Falls ski trails.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 20-by-14 log structure has a front and back porch.
