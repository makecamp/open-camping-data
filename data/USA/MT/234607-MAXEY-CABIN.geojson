    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Maxey Cabin offers a quaint mountain retreat that is ideally located in one of Gallatin National Forests most popular recreation areas. Guests can expect a few creature comforts at the cabin, but they will need to bring some of their own supplies and gear.<br /><br />The cabin is easily accessed by car during the summer months, although Hyalite Canyon Road is closed to all motorized traffic beginning the evening of March 31 through May 15. During that time, guests can reach the cabin by foot, skis or bicycle. Guests arriving in winter should be prepared to ski to the cabin from the end of the plowed road. <br /><br />Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is nestled in Hyalite Canyon, an area with beautiful wildflower meadows during the summer and thick blankets of pristine snow in winter. Evergreen forest and the steep ridges of the Gallatin Mountains surround the cabin. Hyalite Reservoir is nearby.<br /><br />  This area is important habitat for grizzly bears, bison, elk, mule deer, mountain lions, bighorn, wolves and mountain goats.<h4>Recreation:</h4>One of the most popular trails in the area is a 12-kilometer loop that takes hikers, equestrians, snowshoers and cross-country skiers from Maxey Cabin to several waterfalls within the Gallatin Mountains. The trail also offers views of Elephant Mountain and Mount Blackmore.<br /><br />  Hyalite Canyon is a popular destination for ice climbers. Routes in Hyalite Canyon that can be used for ice climbing include Cleopatras Needle,Mummy Cooler, Black Magic and Winter Dance, considered to be one of the best ice climbing routes in the world.<br /><br />   Hyalite Reservoir offers opportunities for non-motorized boating and trout fishing. Elk hunting is excellent in Hyalite Canyon in the fall. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The main cabin has bunk beds with mattresses to sleep up to four people. There is also a wood stove for heat, a table and chairs, a propane lantern, broom and dust pan. <br /><br />A smaller cabin is unheated and is only available in the summer. It provides bunk beds with mattresses to sleep up to two people. The two cabins together can accommodate up to 15 people.<br /><br />A vault toilet and campfire ring are located outside. <br /><br />The cabin does not have water or electricity. Guests need to supply their own drinking water, as well as cooking gear, lanterns or flashlights, bedding, matches, toilet paper, dish soap, towels and other necessities. The cabin will need to be cleaned and all trash removed prior to leaving.",
