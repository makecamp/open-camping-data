    "FacilityDirections": "Crandall Creek Cabin is located approximately 24 miles northeast of Wilsall, and 52 miles from Livingston.<br /><br />From Livingston, travel north on Highway 89 to Wilsall. Turn right from Highway 89 onto Shields River Road. Follow Shields River Road until the pavement ends and turn right at the end of the pavement. Travel approximately 7 miles to a fork in the road, and take the left fork towards the Shields River Camp (approximately 2 milesto the camp). About 100 yards beyond the campground, take a left onto a gated road. The cabin combination code will open the gate. The cabin is located 200 yards down this road. Due to road conditions, a high-clearance, four-wheel drive vehicle is required.<br /><br />From Dec. 2 through March 31, the last seven miles of the access road to Crandall Cabin are not plowed. Plan to ski, snowshoe or snowmobile this distance from the end of the plowed road to the cabin. It is recommended that winter renters carry topographic maps and compasses for navigation, since the route maybe wind-blown and difficult to find.
