    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Vigilante Cabin, also known as the Vigilante Middle House, offers a comfortable place to stay deep in the mountains of southwestern Montana. The cabin used to be a guard station and boasts two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and electricity. It is close to many outdoor recreation opportunities, including fishing, hiking and hunting, as well as off-road vehicle trails and gold panning.<br /><br />The cabin and two adjacent buildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1920s. The white clapboard middle house is available for rent, while the two other houses on the property are still used by Forest Service personnel and volunteers throughout the year.<br /><br /> The cabin is accessible throughout most of the year by vehicle; however, a portion of the road may be difficult to navigate when wet or snow-covered. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring some of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Located along the Ruby River, the facility stands at an elevation of about 6,100 feet between the Snowcrest and Gravelly mountain ranges. It sits in a mostly open and grassy area with just a few trees around it, offering views of the nearby peaks.<br /><br /> A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area, including elk, mule deer, black and grizzly bears, mountain grouse, and other species (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/bdnf/learning/safety-ethics/?cid=FSM9_003342>learn more about bear safety</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests can enjoy fishing the Ruby River for mountain whitefish and rainbow trout.
