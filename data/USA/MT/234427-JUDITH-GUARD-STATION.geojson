    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Judith Guard Station is a historic ranger station dating back to the early 1900s. Designated as a National Historic Site, the cabin is decorated with historically accurate furnishings and wallpaper. It is just a stones throw from the Middle Fork of the Judith River and a small campground with a  picnic area. <br /><br />The cabin, located about 30 miles south of Stanford, may be accessed by regular passenger vehicle until snow season. The road is usually plowed within 2 miles of the station, and a four-wheel-drive vehicle can often make the trip. In times of heavy snowfall, the last half-mile to the cabin may require a snowmobile, skis or snowshoes.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Judith Guard Station sits at an elevation of 5,000 feet on the northern banks of the Middle Fork of the Judith River. The region boasts wooded hills topped with lodgepole pine, Douglas fir and ponderosa.  <br /><br />Wildlife in the region includes mountain lions, bears and bobcats. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, hunting and mountain biking opportunities abound. Nearby hunting includes deer, moose and elk in designated areas. Snow shoeing and cross country skiing are popular in winter. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-story frame building has a modern vault toilet outside and a porch with chairs. Furnishings include propane heating and a cook stove and beds to fit eight guests. A table and chairs plus cooking utensils are provided in the kitchen. Portable propane lanterns are available, but users must bring their own propane cylinders. <br /><br />A hand well with drinking water is available outside from May to September. No water is available during the winter so guests must bring plenty. Guests are asked to bring garbage bags, flashlights, bedding, an ice chest and all personal toiletries.
