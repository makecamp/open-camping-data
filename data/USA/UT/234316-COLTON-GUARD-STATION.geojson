    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Colton Guard Station is located in the Colton Hollow area, approximately 5 miles west of U.S. Highway 191. It is near Vernal, Utah, in the Ashley National Forest. The Civilian Conservation Corps built the complex in 1933 as part of Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal instituted during the Great Depression. It was a residence for rangers who patrolled the forest on horseback prior to the age of modern vehicles. <br /><br />The Ashley National Forest Vernal Ranger District has chosen to rent this guard station to the public so that guests can enjoy a rustic experience similar to that of the first rangers. Colton Guard Station is open for reservations all months of the year, except November, April and May.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by vehicle throughout warmer months and during the winter, access is by snowmobile, cross-country ski or snowshoe travel. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The complex sits in Colton Hollow, at an elevation of 8,500 feet. Aspens and pines surround the site, offering nice shade. Wildlife and summer wildflowers are abundant in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In summer months, numerous hiking, biking, horseback riding and off-road vehicle trails crisscross the area. In winter months, endless snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing opportunities are right out the front door.<h4>Facilities:</h4>A cabin and bunkhouse are located within the complex. The cabin can sleep four people on one twin-size bunk and one double-size futon. No linens, bedding or pillows are provided.

The maximum capacity for overnight guests is 12 people. <br /><br />From mid-June to mid-September, the cabin has running water and a flush toilet. The kitchen has basic amenities including a sink, propane stove/oven, refrigerator, table and four chairs. A basic assortment of pots, pans, dishes and utensils is provided, but guests are encouraged to bring their own supplies. The cabin has a wood-burning stove for heat.
