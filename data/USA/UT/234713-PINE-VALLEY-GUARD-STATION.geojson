    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Pine Valley Guard Station is located in scenic Pine Valley Recreation Area, about 45 minutes from St. George, Utah. Built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the station was used to house a recreation guard during the summer months to assist the visiting public.<br /><br /> The cabin is open year-round and is accessible by vehicle during good road conditions. Winter use of the cabin may require snowshoeing, hiking or cross-country skiing about 1.5 miles from the trailhead at the entrance to the Pine Valley Recreation Area.<br /><br />Many modern amenities are offered, including electricity. Guests only need to bring a few of their own supplies to have a truly comfortable stay in this charming retreat within the Dixie National Forest. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is surrounded by ponderosa pine trees and offers scenic views of the Pine Valley Mountains. At an elevation of 6,800 feet, summer days are warm and nights are cool.<br /><br />The nearby Pine Valley Mountain Wilderness, described as a mountain island surrounded by desert, preserves numerous lush meadows and a beautiful forest of Engelmann spruce in the south, and spruce mixed with fir, pine and large stands of aspen in the north.<br /><br /> The Pine Valley Mountains rise through the entire center of the Pine Valley Wilderness, providing habitat for chipmunks, marmots, red squirrels, blue grouse and a large herd of deer in summer. Elevations rise to a high point at 10,365 feet on Signal Peak in the southern portion.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin is centrally located within the Pine Valley Recreation Area, in close proximity to fishing at Pine Valley Reservoir.
