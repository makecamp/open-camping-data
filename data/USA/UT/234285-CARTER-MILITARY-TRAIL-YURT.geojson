    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Carter Military Trail Yurt provides primitive lodging during summer and fall months, and during the winter, it is open to the public as a warming station for snowmobilers. It is located in the Ashley National Forest, at roughly 9,800 feet in elevation. It is approximately 25 air miles northwest of Vernal, Utah, and is situated near the historic Carter Military Trail and the Highline Trail. <br /><br />The yurt can be accessed by vehicle, from Vernal, Utah. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<p><iframe frameborder=0 height=242 scrolling=no src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/OzULbiBGAGE?feature=player_embedded width=385> </iframe> </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>The yurt is situated on a scenic plateau, high in the Uinta Moutains of northeastern Utah. A mixed pine forest covers the area, offering limited shade. Wildlife and summer wildflowers are abundant. <br /><br />The Red Cloud Loop Scenic Backway is nearby, meandering through miles of aspen groves, open meadows and lodgepole pine forests. Petroglyphs and historic sites dot the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The yurt provides access to numerous hiking, biking and off-road vehicle trails, including the Carter Military Trail and the Highline Trail. The Carter Military Trail served as a military supply road from the legendary Oregon Trail in southwestern Wyoming, over the Uinta Mountains and to the Uinta Basin. The route winds up and down hills, through marshes and disappears in some spots, but it remains a significant trail due to its historic and archaeological culture. <br /><br />Many lakes and reservoirs in the area are open to canoeing and fishing.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The yurt is approximately 224 square-feet (less than 16 feet in diameter) and has limited amenities. Indoor plumbing, running water and electricity are not available. It can accommodate up to six people for overnight visits. Parking is available for a maximum of one RV/camp trailer and two vehicles. Tent camping is allowed outside the yurt. <br /><br />The yurt has one, double-bunk bed with mattresses, that will sleep four people. No linens, bedding or pillows are provided. <br /><br />The yurt is equipped with a heavy-duty propane case stove for cooking, a wood burning stove for heat and a folding table and chairs. A basic assortment of pots, pans, dishes and utensils is available, but guests are encouraged to bring their own supplies. A vault toilet is located outside.<br /><br />One portable propane Coleman lantern is provided but guests must bring extra propane canisters and their own mantles. The Forest Service provides propane for the stove. The tanks are located outside, beneath the deck and guests must activate the tanks upon arrival and deactivate them upon departure.<br /><br /><h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Numerous scenic driving routes on maintained dirt roads crisscross the area, providing miles of trails for off-road vehicles enthusiasts, hikers and mountain bikers. Trails lead to Long Park, Oaks Park and East Park reservoirs, Hacking Lake, Red Lake and Lily Pad Lake, as well as overlooks, forests, meadows and historic sites.<br /><br />Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area is known not only for its beautiful red cliffs, but also for world-class fishing for lake, brown and rainbow trout. Boating, water skiing, jet skiing, canoeing, kayaking, swimming and scuba diving are popular activities on the reservoir.",
