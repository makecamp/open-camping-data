    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Altamont Campground is located along the beautiful Alpine Loop Scenic Byway high in the Wasatch Mountains. The Mount Timpanogos Wilderness Area is adjacent. Visitors enjoy hiking the nearby Timpooneke Trail to the summit of Mount Timpanogos.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground lies among dense, shady stands of aspen, fir and spruce trees at an elevation of 7,400 feet. Wildlife and summer wildflowers are abundant and autumn leaves put on quite a show. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking is very popular in the area. The 15-mile round-trip Timpooneke Trail begins across the road at the Timpooneke Campground and climbs to the summit of rugged Mount Timpanogos. Aspen Grove Trail is nearby, leading to the summit as well. Horses are allowed on Timpooneke Trail.<br /><br />The rough, dirt Timpooneke Road also begins across the road, nearly circumnavigates Mount Timpanogos and offers excellent mountain biking and birding opportunities.<br /><br />The campground sits along the 20-mile paved Alpine Loop Scenic Byway. It passes through alpine canyons, mountain meadows, aspen groves and pine forests, offering breathtaking views of the Wasatch Range.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Altamont offers a large picnic shelter, flush toilets and drinking water. Several picnic tables and a campfire circle are located in the shelter. The short road from the Alpine Loop to the campsite is paved, as is a large parking area. The site can accommodate up to 100 guests.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Timpanogos Cave National Monument is a few miles down American Fork Canyon, offering a rewarding but steep 1.5-mile hike to a guided tour of the spectacular three-room cave system.<br /><br />Cascade Springs is just 9 miles from the campground. Family-friendly, accessible boardwalks loop around the natural springs.<br /><br />Nearby Tibble Fork and Silver Flat Reservoirs offer canoeing, kayaking and fishing for rainbow, brook and brown trout. A portion of the north shore at Tibble Fork is accessible. Both reservoirs are open only to non-motorized watercraft. Scuba divers frequent Tibble Forks south shore.",
