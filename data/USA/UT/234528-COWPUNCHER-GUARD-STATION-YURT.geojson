    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cowpuncher Yurt is located in the Dixie National Forest, 20 miles northeast of the town of Escalante in southern Utah. The yurt is situated just off the Hells Backbone Road and is accessed by road during summer and fall. When the roads are closed by snow, an 8.5 mile snowmobile ride will get you there. <br /> <br /> <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Cowpuncher Yurt sits in a quiet meadow secluded by pine and aspen groves next to a small trout stream. The elevation at the yurt is 8,000 feet and the adjacent pine and aspen covered slopes quickly rise up to 8,900 feet. Summer days are warm and nights are cool. <br /> <br /><h4>Recreation:</h4>The yurt is surrounded by trails, including the Great Western Trail which offer abundant opportunities for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Horses may be kept in a corral just down the road. Pine Creek flows through the site offering excellent trout fishing. The scenic Hells Backbone Road is minutes away and is a popular scenic drive for both cars and OHVs. <br /> <br /><h4>Facilities:</h4>At 20 feet in diameter, this yurt is comfortably furnished with two sets of bunk beds with mattresses, two cots, table and chairs, wood stove, propane stove, lanterns, pots and pans, dishes and utensils. A small deck extends the space outside with a picnic table and fire ring below. A vault toilet is located a short walk from the yurt. Firewood is provided. Horses may be kept in a corral just down the road. <br /> <br /> <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Cowpuncher Yurt offers a cool escape from the surrounding desert landscape and is often used as a base to explore the surrounding area. The Escalante area of southern Utah offers breathtaking scenery nearly everywhere you look. Sightseeing along Road 153, Hells Backbone Road, and Utah Highway 12, a National All American Highway, is very popular. The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Anasazi State Park, and the Escalante Petrified Forest State Park are all located in the area. <br /> <br />",
