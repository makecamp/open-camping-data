    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Trout Creek Guard Station is located in the Trout Creek area, approximately 21 miles west of U.S. Highway 191 near Vernal, in eastern Utah. It is part of the beautiful Ashley National Forest. The Civilian Conservation Corps built the complex in 1934 as part of Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal instituted during the Great Depression. It was a residence for rangers who patrolled the forest on horseback prior to the age of modern vehicles.<br /><br />The Ashley National Forest Vernal Ranger District has chosen to rent this guard station to the public so guests can enjoy a primitive experience similar to that of the first rangers. The cabin is open for reservations all months of the year except November, April and May.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The charming red cabin sits at the edge of a meadow, just above Trout Creek.  A scenic forest of pines and aspens surrounds the expansive meadow. Wildlife and summer wildflowers are abundant. <h4>Recreation:</h4>In summer months, numerous hiking, biking and off-road trails crisscross the area. In winter months, endless snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing opportunities are right out the door.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can sleep four people on two, twin-sized bunk beds. No linens, bedding or pillows are provided. Up to eight additional guests can camp outside within the complex. <br /><br />The kitchen contains basic amenities including a sink, propane stove and oven, refrigerator, table and four chairs. A basic assortment of pots, pans, dishes and utensils is provided, but guests are encouraged to bring their own. The cabin has a wood stove inside for heat, and a campfire ring with a grill is outside. A vault toilet is provided outside the cabin.  Solar lights are provided, however, due to varying weather conditions, they are not reliable.  Please be prepared with battery powered lanterns or flashlights.<br /><br />From approximately Sept. 26 to March 31, most amenities are shut off, including the refrigerator. The operable amenities during this time are an outdoor vault toilet, propane stove for cooking and a wood-burning stove for heat.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeP5ZS95L4Y>Click here</a> to view a video of the details about Trout Creek Guard Station. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Numerous scenic driving routes on maintained dirt roads crisscross the area, providing miles of trails for off-road enthusiasts, hikers and mountain bikers.
