The byway is part of the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah, which are known for their abundant recreational opportunities and scenic beauty.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is located on a forested hillside above Highway 150 and is quite secluded. Ponderosa pines tower over the site, offering nice shade. Sagebrush and summer wildflowers dot the landscape.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Numerous hiking, biking and horseback riding trails crisscross this beautiful region, including Yellow Pine, North Fork and Shingle Creek Trails, which all begin nearby. Off-road vehicle trails are in the vicinity.<br /><br />The Lower Provo River is below the site and across the highway, offering good trout fishing.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Ponderosa contains one group site that can accommodate up to 100 people. It is equipped with large picnic tables and campfire circles.
