    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Pocket Picnic Shelter is a popular location for large groups that want to enjoy a secluded area. The densely forested area was a Civilian Conservation Corps camp from 1938 to 1942. Some remains of the old camp are still visible in the area.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The picnic shelter is located off the Ridge and Valley Scenic Byway. The area is named for its unique geology formed when water-soluble limestone was eroded over time, dropping the ground level. The surrounding ridges, which contain iron ore are filled with pockets.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors enjoy the 3.5-mile Pocket Foot Trail that loops between the picnic area and a nearby campground. Interpretive signs are placed along the route, including a brief description of the area. It is a relatively wide path and a nice, easy walk.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The accessible picnic shelter is available for group use with a reservation. If the area is not reserved, it is available on a first-come, first-served basis. The facility can accommodate up to 75 people and 20 vehicles.<br><br>The site is equipped with tables and grills. Accessible vault toilets are also provided. Drinking water is available across the parking area, in the main picnic area.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The closest town is Dalton, Georgia, which is about 25 miles east of the picnic area. Dalton has numerous grocery stores, restaurants and gas stations available.",
