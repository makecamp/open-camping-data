    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Dam West Day Use Area offers reservable group picnic shelters on the shore of Lake Shelbyville in the heart of central Illinois.<br /><br />The lake and surrounding land offer outdoor activities for people of all ages, including fishing, swimming, picnicking and simply relaxing. Boaters have year-round access to the lake, even during high lake elevations.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>This facility is mostly open with a clear view of the lake. About half of the land around the lake is forested, with oak and hickory as the dominant species. Foliage turns a variety of red, orange, purple and yellow each fall, while prairie flowers dot the landscape in spring and summer. <br /><br />Numerous species of songbirds, shorebirds, waterfowl and raptors inhabit the lake area, as do mammals such as cottontail rabbit, white-tail deer, gray and fox squirrel, muskrat and mink.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Boaters have access to a multi-lane boat ramp and courtesy dock, and hikers can explore the shore using a number of trails. The General Dacey Trail begins at Dam West Recreation Area and makes its way through Shelbyvilles Forrest Park. <br /><br />Lake Shelbyville offers a multitude of fishing opportunities for catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, muskie, walleye, white bass and bluegill. For those without a boat, several managed ponds with farmed fish are available around the lake. <br /><br />Hunting areas, located a short drive away, offer numerous game species, including quail, rabbit, pheasant, deer, dove, turkey, waterfowl and woodcock.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Dam West Day Use Area has four group picnic shelters; three can accommodate about 50 people each, while one can host up to 100. The shelters each have six picnic tables, and the facility provides volleyball courts, a large public beach with showers and a playground.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Wolf Creek State Park, Woods Lake Waterfowl Refuge and Okaw Bluff Wetlands Complex are popular locations for wildlife watching, birding and hunting near Lake Shelbyville.",
