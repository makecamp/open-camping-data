    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>South Marcum Day Use Area sits along the banks of Rend Lake in the heart of southern Illinois.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Completed in the early 1970s, Rend Lake is a dam project that was built to provide dependable water supplies to nearby counties. Since then, the dam and lake have become a natural haven for fish and wildlife as well as a recreational haven for more than 3 million visitors each year.<br /><br />Rend Lake consists of 18,900 acres of water and 20,000 acres of land. Surrounded by hills, prairies and bottomlands, the scenery at the lake never disappoints.   <h4>Recreation:</h4>Rend Lake is a relatively shallow reservoir, filled with countless native species of fish, making it an ideal angling destination. Abundant and large crappie and channel catfish are especially popular, along with hybrid striped bass and flathead catfish. <br /><br />Birding is a popular pastime at the park, and the area provides the ideal habitat for a diverse range of bird species. <br /><br />The Rend Lake Bike Trail offers opportunities for hiking and biking, along with the nearby Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park, which also offers horseback riding.<br /><br />The lake has earned the reputation of being one of the best waterfowl hunting areas in the state for both ducks and geese. There are also plenty of opportunities for archery and firearm deer hunting at higher elevations. Another popular attraction is the annual controlled pheasant hunt held at Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park.<br /><br />Ranger-led educational programs are available at the Rend Lake Visitor Center. Boat rentals are also available at the Rend Lake Marina.<h4>Facilities:</h4>South Marcum Day Use Area  Day Use Area features a large picnic shelter with tables, grills and drinking water.
