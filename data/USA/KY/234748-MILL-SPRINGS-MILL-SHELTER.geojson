    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mill Springs Mill is a day-use facility located on the shores of Lake Cumberland, overlooking the main body of the lake. There is no overnight camping allowed in the area. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Mill Springs Mill, a water-powered grist mill listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1877 and is on the public lands of Lake Cumberland. Its 40-foot overshot water wheel is one of the largest in the world and probably the largest water wheel currently operating. The mill and water wheel were restored as a bicentennial project in 1976, and are now operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an interpretive demonstration. Tours of the mill are conducted for the public during the recreation season. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Lake Cumberland is the largest man-made lake east of the Mississippi River. Its large surface acreage and over 1,200 miles of shoreline provide a myriad of recreational opportunities. The lake has an abundance of largemouth, smallmouth, white and Kentucky bass, bluegill, crappie, rockfish, and walleye making it a favorite among anglers. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Mill Springs Mill offers a small reservable group picnic shelter and six picnic sites with tables and grills. Flush toilets, drinking water and a courtesy tie-up boat slip are also provided. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>While visiting the Mill you can tour the historic Millers home, the Brown-Lanier house (ca.1830-1860) that was used as a headquarters and hospital during the Civil War battle of Mill Springs and now also functions as a bed and breakfast. Conley Bottom Marina is 10 minutes away with a campground, boat rentals, a restaurant and general store.",
