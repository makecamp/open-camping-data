    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Ozark Pavilion sits in the middle of the Ozark Campground near the impressive bluffs of the Buffalo River. Bring a picnic lunch or pack up your grill for a day of fresh air and outdoor activities.<br /><br />The big river isnt just a picturesque backdrop for your picnic - it also offers an array of river sports like canoeing, kayaking, tubing, swimming and fishing.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The pavilion is located along the Buffalo National River with views of lush forests and high, riverside limestone bluffs. It is one of the few free-flowing rivers remaining in the contiguous U.S., with 135 miles of undammed waters. It cuts through the Arkansas Ozarks to reach its final destination at the White River.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Buffalo River Trailhead is next to the pavilion. The scenic trail spans a massive 36.5 miles of the Buffalo River from Boxely to Pruitt, and is ideal for hiking or backpacking.<br /><br />Peak season for canoeing, kayaking and tubing is spring to early summer.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The covered picnic area seats up to 25 people. Electricity is available but its recommended you bring your own grill. Flush toilets and drinking water are provided.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearby town of Jasper offers restaurants, gas stations and groceries. The Hilary Jones Wildlife Museum and Elk Center is just north of Jasper. It features displays of elk, white-tailed deer and ducks, as well as freshwater aquariums, wildlife paintings and a gift shop.",
