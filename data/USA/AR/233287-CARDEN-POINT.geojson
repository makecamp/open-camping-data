    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Carden Point Day Use Park sits along the shores of Nimrod Lake and Dam, cradled between Arkansas Ouachita and Ozark Mountains. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Nimrod Dam was completed in 1942 as part of a comprehensive plan for flood control and development of water resources in the Fourche LaFave River. Although recreation was not part of the initial mission of the dam project, the lake and surrounding 21,000 acres of pristine land have now become a recreational oasis for outdoor enthusiasts. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing is one of the most popular activities at the lake, with an abundance of catfish, bluegill, bass and crappie available. <br /><br />Boating, water skiing and tubing are also popular, with 11 boat ramps conveniently located around the lake.<br /><br />Hikers will enjoy the Forest Hills Trail, a 1.5-mile self-guided nature trail that starts on the south side of Nimrod Dam and meanders through the wooded hills and valleys.<br /><br />Visitors are likely to spot white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkey, bobwhite quail, squirrel, rabbit, fox, mink, black bear, dove and waterfowl in the area. Seasonal hunting is also permitted throughout the lake, except in or near recreation areas.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Carden Point features a large group picnic shelter, with drinking water, grills and tables. A playground, horseshoe pit and swimming beach make the area ideal for large parties or family functions. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Nimrod Lake is conveniently located adjacent to State Highway 7, a National Scenic Byway and other nearby points of interest like Petit Jean State Park, Mount Nebo State Park and Hot Springs National Park.",
