    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Jess Judy is a group camping facility located on the South Branch of the Potomac River, in West Virginia;s eastern panhandle, about 1.5 miles south of Big Bend. Canoeing, fishing and hiking are popular activities.<br /><br />About 1.3 million visitors come to the Monongahela National Forest each year, and its no surprise why. The forest is a drivable distance from cities like Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh, yet the density of flora, fauna and picturesque mountains seem like a world away from any city.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Jess Judy is situated in the northern portion of the Monongahela National Forest, on the western banks of the river. The region boasts beautiful old-growth forests that become vibrant with color in fall.<br /><br />the South Branch of the Potomac River runs north through Smoke Hole Canyon, which bears a name of uncertain origin. One theory is Native Americans once used the caves in the canyon for smoking meat, which created &quot;smoke holes.&quot; Another is that misty fog often lies along the river and ascends in what looks like smoke from a hole.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors enjoy canoeing and fishing on the river, and hiking on local trails. Thirty miles of maintained trails can be found nearby and mountain biking is permitted on most of them. One highly recommended trail for hikers and backpackers is the North Fork Mountain Trail.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground has three primitive group sites that can accommodate up to 40 people each. No drinking water is available, so please bring your own supply. Accessible vault toilets are provided.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Traverse through narrow, steep valleys and over rolling, tree-topped mountains on the Highland Scenic Highway. This 43-mile drive includes highlights like Cranberry Glades Botanical Area, Summit Lake, and the Falls of Hills Creek.",
