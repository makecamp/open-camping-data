    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Middle Mountain Cabins are nestled in a small grassy opening near a small pond and Camp Five Run, a hiking trail that leads into the Laurel Fork South Wilderness. The cabins are secluded and offer a quiet retreat for visitors. Rented as a single unit, Middle Mountain Cabins include a main cabin with a kitchen, and two historic sleeping cabins. <br /><br />The cabins occupy a 3.5-acre space about 18 miles south of Wymer. The two smaller cabins were built in 1939 and served as bunk houses for Forest Service employees. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Middle Mountain Cabins (elevation 3,750 feet) is located on a half-acre grassy field surrounded by red spruce and yellow birch. The cabins sit near the 11,839-acre Laurel Fork South Wilderness.<br /><br />The Laurel Fork of the Cheat River is characterized by its narrow valley floor with regularly dissected slopes and long narrow ridges. The continuous forest cover of primarily Beech, Maple, Birch, and Cherry is occasionally broken up by beautiful meadows along the river. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Middle Mountain Cabins (elevation 3,750 feet) are located on a half-acre grassy field surrounded by red spruce and yellow birch. The cabins sit near the Laurel Fork South Wilderness. Several other trails around the Middle Mountain Cabins include the High Falls of Cheat Trail # 345, which is a 2.9-mile trek to the beautiful waterfalls.<br /><br />The West Fork Rail Trail #312 is an old railroad grade and runs along the West Fork of the Greenbrier River. The Allegheny Trial # 701 spans many districts on the Monongahela National Forest.<br /><br />Fishing is popular on the Cheat, Glady Fork, Shavers Fork, and West and East Forks of the Greenbrier River. Lake fishing is popular at Spruce Knob Lake and Buffalo Lake. A state fishing license, National Forest Stamp, a Conservation stamp, and a trout stamp are required. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The main cabin is a single story log building with a gabled roof that extends to cover a full length porch. Inside are exposed log rafters and tie beams. Outside there is a picnic table, grill and campfire ring. A four car gravel parking area is located beside the grassy clearing.<br /><br />All cabins have fireplaces. Firewood is provided, but the supply is not guaranteed. There is no water in the cabin, but an outside handpump for drinking water is available. An outdoor vault toilet is located onsite. Each sleeping cabin contains two sets of bunk beds, while the main cabin contains one full size bed for a total capacity of 10 people.<br /><br />The kitchen includes a gas stove, cabinets, a table with six chairs, two lounge chairs, some pots, pans, dishes and silverware. There is no electricity available. Visitors should bring food, matches or a lighter, an ax, small saw, bedding, lanterns for each cabin, flashlights, food, ice chests, and personal gear. Food should be protected as field mice and bears frequent the area. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>A convenience store and fuel can be found in Bartow and a larger grocery store can be found in Elkins. Due to rural mountain roads, visitors should expect to drive for at least an hour to reach these towns.",
