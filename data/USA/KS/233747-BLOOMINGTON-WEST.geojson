    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Bloomington West is a spacious group campground that sits under an umbrella of trees west of Clinton Dam and Lake in the hills of Kansas.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Congress authorized Clinton Lake in 1962, and the finished reservoir was filled in 1980. While the Dam and Reservoir were originally built for flood control, the area has now become a recreational oasis for millions of visitors to enjoy the beautiful green Kansas backdrop.<br /><br />Clinton Lakes beautiful setting of steep bluffs, wooded shoreline and clear water is unequaled among Kansas lakes. Shoreline development has been limited in an effort to preserve as much of the natural setting as possible.<br /><br />Clinton spans 8 miles up the Wakarusa Valley and covers 7,000 surface acres. If the lake ever approaches the top of its flood pool, an additional 5,800 acres will be covered, extending the area to 13 miles along the valley floor.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A horseshoe pit, sand volleyball court, playground and softball field are all provided at the campground, making it the perfect spot for entertaining large groups and family functions.<br /><br />However, Clinton Lake is the main attraction, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, canoeing, jet skiing, swimming and countless other water sports.<br /><br />The lakes fish and wildlife resources provide sightseers, fishermen, and hunters ample opportunities for their sports, and Clinton Lake is well-stocked with crappie, walleye, channel catfish and white bass.<br /><br />Wildlife viewing is also a popular activity, with bald eagles, white-tailed deer, Canada geese, wild turkey and other wildlife in abundance at Clinton Lake. <br /><br />Three trail systems are located around Clinton Lake, including the North Shore, South Shore and the George Latham Trails.
