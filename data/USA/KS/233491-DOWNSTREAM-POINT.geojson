The facility has basketball courts and is located on the lake shore. <br /><br />After picnicking, visitors can venture onto several hiking and equestrian trails nearby including Big Hill Lake Horse Trail, a 17-mile trail with a variety of terrain for all ages to explore.<br /><br />Big Hill Lake is known for being a trophy lake for fishing. Principal species of sport fish include largemouth bass, crappie, channel and flathead catfish, bluegill, walleye and smallmouth bass.
