    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Summit Guard Station Bunkhouse sets the stage for a truly relaxing getaway. Located on the breaks of Meacham Canyon in Umatilla National Forest, spectacular views of the Blue Mountains are guaranteed. The rustic bunkhouse, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, dates back to 1938. <br /><br />The site of the cabin was the Summit Ranger Station in 1908, when the land was part of the Wenaha National Forest. Wenaha was one of the first national forests in the country, established in 1907. It was renamed Umatilla National Forest in 1920. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Summit Guard Station is located on a high ridge nestled in an open stand of large Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. The view to the south and west from this ridge-top setting is exceptional. Prominent points in the area include Wilbur Mountain, Spring Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain and Green Mountain.<br /><br />Bird species in the region include kinglets, sparrows, chickadees and hummingbirds, while wildflowers include larkspur, lupine and orchids.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Bird and wildlife watching is exceptional at Summit. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The single-room cabin accommodates up to four guests. The red, wood framed cabin has four beds with mattresses, a table and four chairs, and is equipped with a propane cook stove, propane lights and a propane heater. The cabin is stocked with a limited supply of pots, pans, eating utensils and cleaning supplies. A vault toilet is located a short distance from the cabin and additional guests may use the yard to pitch a tent.<br /><br />No water is available on-site, so guests must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to bring include food, bedding, towels, garbage bags, dish soap and a first aid kit. Its a great idea to bring binoculars as well. <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/umatilla/recreation/recarea/?recid=57049>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Whitman Route Overlook is a short drive away, boasting views of Meacham Canyon and the Hell Hole Roadless Area, as well as a look back into the history of the area.",
