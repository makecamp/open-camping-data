    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Chinquapin Group Campground is located at the former site of the Camp Oregon Caves Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp. During the Great Depression from 1933- 1941 the Camp Oregon Caves Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp was home to over 200 youth who worked on projects in the Siskiyou National Forest and the Oregon Caves National Monument. Today, the only structure currently remaining at the site is the historic Grayback Ranger Station, constructed by CCC crews around 1936 and located immediately adjacent to the Chinquapin Group Campground. The large Port- Orford cedar tree located near the back of the parking area was dedicated in 2011 as the 56th Oregon State Heritage Tree and is a living reminder of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Camp Oregon Caves CCC camp.<br />The large meadow at the Chinquapin Group Campground makes a great location for group events such as reunions, church camps, school field trips and scouting events. Water, picnic tables and fire rings are readily available at three locations in the campground and a restroom is located at the back of the parking area. Within a short walking distance there are swimming areas in Grayback Creek and creek side trails with meadows, marshes, spring wildflowers, wildlife and berry picking. No electricity is available at the Chinquapin Group Campground. Visitors can continue 10 miles east on Hwy 46 and visit Oregon Caves National Monument for a tour of one of the few marble caves in the world.",
