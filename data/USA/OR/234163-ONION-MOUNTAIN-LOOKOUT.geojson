    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>THIS FACILITY IS CLOSED TO RESERVATIONS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE<br /><br />Onion Mountain lookout sits atop a 12-foot tower at an elevation of 4,438 feet, offering guests expansive mountain views in southwestern Oregon.<br /><br /> The original Onion Mountain Lookout was a raised platform, built on top of a tower in 1916. In 1924, a second lookout without a tower was built on site. The current structure was placed on site in 1952 and served as a fire lookout and Aircraft Warning Service observation station.<br /><br />The lookout offers a unique lodging experience in the Rouge River-Siskiyou National Forest, but visitors are required to bring a few of their own supplies to enjoy a safe and comfortable stay. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>On a clear day, Onion Mountain offers panoramic views of layered mountainous terrain and forest stretching out in all directions.<br /><br />  Onion Mountain is named for the tiny wild onions that grow among the rocks at the summit. In early summer, the area is dotted with plumes of Bear Grass, bright yellow Snow Mountain Buckwheat and purple penstemon. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, mountain biking, stargazing and wildlife viewing are popular among guests to this lookout.<br /><br />On trails throughout the area, hikers will enjoy mountain views, old-growth forest canopies and natural pools for swimming.<br /><br />The lookout is located near the Taylor Creek/Onion Way mountain loop, a trail popular among mountain biking enthusiasts.<br /><br />At night, the rustic cabin becomes an astronomers heaven as the expansive night sky is littered with a dazzling display of stars and planets.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin offers a 14 x 14 foot room with large windows on all sides. It is designed for one or two people, and is furnished with a bed with a mattress, a table and chairs. Amenities include a propane cooking stove, refrigerator, and lanterns. There is no propane heater.<br /><br />There is also no water on site, so visitors must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper and garbage bags.<br /><br /> A primitive vault toilet is located near the lookout as well as space for four or five tents. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visit Crater Lake National Park and learn about its unique natural and cultural history.  Reaching depths of 1,943 feet, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and one of the 10 deepest lakes in the world.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.nps.gov/orca/index.htm target=_blank>Oregon Caves National Monument</a> is within a hours drive.",
