    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Ochoco Divide Group Site is a convenient place to camp while traveling across scenic State Highway 26 by bicycle or car. Resting at the top of the Ochoco Divide at an elevation of 4,700 ft., the group site is set on a hill away from the road as an extension of the general campground. Summertime in the Ochoco National Forest brings pleasant temperatures; the campground is closed during winter.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The scenery surrounding the campground alternates between thick Ponderosa pine forests and grassy meadows, though shortly beyond the campground the road descends into lower-elevation, arid canyon lands. <br /><br />One of the most unique geologic features of the Ochoco National Forest is the thunder egg, Oregons official state rock. Thunder eggs are small, colorful, round volcanic rocks similar to geodes that have been exposed over time. The U.S. Forest Service has designated specific sites for rock hounding.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The group site of the Ochoco Divide Campground is mainly used by touring cyclists. It is also a good place to take a relaxing stroll through the woods. There are opportunities for hunting, mountain biking and hiking in the national forest surrounding the facility. Several trailheads begin at the Bandit Springs rest stop about one mile from the campground on Highway 26.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The group site is part of the main Ochoco Divide Campground. There is no drinking water at the group or main campground. Visitors are advised to bring their own, though bottled water is available through the camp host if necessary. The group site can comfortably fit up to 12 people; no more than 35 are allowed. Parking is limited. Campers must park at the base of a small hill and walk up to the site. There is a day use area at the group site as well.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is less than an hour away. Hike amongst the Painted Hills and famed fossils, take a journey through time at the museum at Sheep Rock or picnic beneath the beautiful mountain scenery.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.nps.gov/joda/index.htm target=_blank>John Day Fossil Beds National Monument</a>",
