    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Ochoco Ranger Station was established in 1906 as part of the Western Division of the Blue Mountain Forest Reserves. By 1911, Ochoco Ranger Station was one of seven ranger districts on the newly formed Ochoco National Forest. The site quickly grew from a single office/residence building to a compound with an office, residence, storage building and barn. This house was constructed in 1940 specifically for the District Ranger by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the US Forest Service. It showcases the rustic architectural styles common to this era.<br /><br />The scenic location of the Ochoco Ranger Rental House offers easy access to Walton Lake, Big Summit Prairie and the Ochoco National Forest. This rental allowsvisitors to enjoy all the comforts of home in a beautiful, natural setting. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Nestled under big ponderosa pine, the house is situated in upper Ochoco Valley and surrounded by the Ochoco Mountain range. The highest peak in this range is LookoutMountain, at 6,900 feet, which is near the house. The Ochoco Mountain range is known for its unusual rock formations.<br /><br /> Visitors to this area may be lucky enough to see wild free-roaming horses. Other wildlife around the forest include squirrels, chipmunks, antelope, deer, elk, hawks, osprey, eagles and great horned owls.<h4>Recreation:</h4>This house is a year-round rental, allowing visitors to participate in summer or winter recreation. The 8-mile Lookout Mountain Trail #804 begins at Ochoco Ranger Station and takes hikers to the top of Lookout Mountain.<br /><br />Nearby Walton Lake, a developed recreation site, is located about 7 miles northeast of Ochoco Ranger Station and offers an easy hike around the lake that also connects with the more difficult Round Mountain Trail. Walton Lake offers the opportunity to fish, swim or paddle.<br /><br />Winter enthusiasts can enjoy Walton Sno-Park, located just past Walton Lake, which offers cross-country ski trails and snowmobile routes. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This beautifully appointed two-story house has two large bedrooms and a half bath with a flush toilet upstairs, and a bedroom and a full bath with a flush toilet and hot shower downstairs. The house is furnished with two queen beds and three twin beds. <br /><br />There is a well-equipped kitchen with cook stove and refrigerator, as well as basic kitchenware and cleaning supplies, including a vacuum cleaner. The large dining room has a table and chairs for eight people. Relax and enjoy the fully furnished living room. The house is fully electric and offers a two-car garage. The fireplace is not in use.<br /><br />Food, trash bags, towels, washcloths, dish soap, first aid kits, flashlights, extra batteries and bedding are not provided.
