From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, biking, and boating in summer and early fall, Deer Creek Flat offers excellent skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.<br /><br />The North Umpqua River, adjacent to this campground, drains portions of the western side of the Cascade Range.
