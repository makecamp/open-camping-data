    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Warner Mountain Lookout is the winter wonderland destination for avid winter sports enthusiasts looking for a challenge. This replica of an old cupola-style lookout sits on a high vantage point of Warner Ridge at an altitude of 5,300 feet in the Willamette National Forest approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon.<br /><br /> This is a very remote location. The journey to the tower can be long, up to 10 miles on foot, and risky as the wind and snow whips across the ridge. Experience in cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended.<br /><br />The reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lookout towers over forest cover of noble fir, mountain hemlock and silver fir at the crest of Warner Mountain. The lookout is close to Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area, with a diverse habitat ranging from meadows to rocky cliffs and dotted with high-elevation conifers.<br /><br />Willamette National Forest offers prime habitat for such species as Roosevelt elk, black bears, northern bald eagles, mule deer and bobcats, among other wildlife.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Winter recreationists can enjoy cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling on the terrain in the nearby Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 14x14-ft. cabin sits atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a catwalk. The cabin accommodates 4 people and is furnished with one double bed that comfortably sleeps two, a table and chairs, propane stoves for heating and cooking, cookware, dishes, broom and a 2-way radio for emergency use. <br /><br /> There is an outhouse nearby. <br /><br />No water or electricity is provided. Guests typically melt snow for their supply of water for drinking, cooking and washing. A large pot is provided for this purpose. <br /><br /> Items such as bedding, extra mattresses, flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, and towels are not reliably available after mid-season. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving. <br /><br />",
