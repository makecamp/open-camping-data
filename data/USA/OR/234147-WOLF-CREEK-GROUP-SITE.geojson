Explosive geologic events have shaped the distinctive landscape on the nearly 1 million-acre forest, and provide spectacular scenery as well as an abundance of natural and cultural resources.<br /><br /> Flowing adjacent to this campground is the North Umpqua River, a tributary of the Umpqua River, and a designated National Wild and Scenic River. Possessing remarkable values related to wildlife, culture, recreation and scenery, the North Umpqua River is renowned for its emerald green waters and fly fishing.<br /><br />Several designated wilderness areas provide undisturbed solitude for visitors. Encompassing 19,100 acres, Boulder Creek Wilderness offers dense old-growth forests and steep terrain that tower above Boulder Creek, which runs through the heart of the wilderness.<br /><br />Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife common to the area. From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, biking and boating in summer and early fall, Wolf Creek offers excellent skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.<br /><br />A 1.2-mile trail that begins in the campground is popular among hikers.
