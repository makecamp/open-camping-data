    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Fry Meadow Guard Station offers the peaceful solitude of a remote nature-lovers paradise just south of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and west of the Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic River. The surrounding area is steeped with native history and culture as it was once home to the Nez Perce, Umatilla, Walla Walla and Cayuse Indians. <br /><br />This site was originally established as a ranger station before 1908, part of the former Wenaha National Forest. The existing cabin was constructed in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and was used as a remote guard station until about 1980. The two-room cabin provides a pleasant escape for up to four guests. Additional guests may pitch a tent in the yard.<br /><br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4>Tucked beneath the shady canopy of towering spruce and fir, the guard station sits at the edge of an expansive meadow of grasses and wildflowers, such as lupine, larkspur, monkey flower and orchid. <br /><br />As the afternoon slides into evening, deer and elk come out to graze. Hawks perch in treetops or glide over the meadow, scanning the grass for field mice and other critters. In the morning, many varieties of birds, including flycatchers, hummingbirds, swallows, chickadees, creepers, wrens, kinglets, thrushes, sparrows, warblers, tanagers and finches, greet the day.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness offers more than 200 miles of managed trails for hiking and horseback riding in summer. The Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic River offers float boating, salmon and steelhead fishing. Hunting is available nearby. <br /><br />Seasonal mushroom and berry picking can also be enjoyed. Huckleberries, blackberries and morel mushrooms are among the edible picks. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a classic 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps two-room design. It is equipped with a propane cook stove, propane heater and propane lights. Furnishings include four beds with mattresses, tables and chairs, limited cleaning supplies, cooking pots and utensils. A vault toilet is located a short distance from the cabin.<br /><br />The cabin has no water. Visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. Please bring sleeping bags or bedding, a flashlight, first aid kit, washcloths, towels and dish soap. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-fry-meadow-gs.shtml>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>This site is located about 25 miles northeast of Elgin, Oregon, which offers general stores and gas stations.",
