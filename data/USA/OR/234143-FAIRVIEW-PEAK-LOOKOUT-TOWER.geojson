    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>This lookout is perched atop Fairview Peak at an elevation of 5,933 feet, offering visitors a unique lodging experience in Umpqua National Forest in southwest Oregon. <br /><br />The Fairview Peak site was historically occupied as a fire lookout since the 1920s. During the late 50s and early 60s the tower was used as an Air Force &quot;gap filler&quot; radar station. Having a range of around 65 miles, these radars were placed in areas where it was thought enemy aircraft could fly low to avoid detection by the lower-range radars of the permanent and mobile radar networks.<br /><br />   The lookout tower is available for reservations from mid-June or early July through mid-October, and typically unavailable during peak fire season, usually the months of August and September, when it is in use for fire administration. High-clearance vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>On a clear day, guests at Fairview Peak Lookout can see north to Mount Hood, south to Crater Lake and Mt. McLaughlin and east to many prominent peaks in the Cascade Range. Snow drifts melt in June, welcoming the arrival of brilliant patches of wildflowers that splash color on the steep, rocky timbered hillsides. By October, vivid autumn color may be surprised with an early dusting of snow.<br /><br />Large mammals such as elk, deer, black bear, and cougar, as well as the smaller residents like squirrels, fox, raccoons and bats, are supported by the areas diverse forest habitats.

The historic remains of Bohemia City can be viewed from Fairview Peak Lookout and from Bohemia Mountain trail.

Just east of the summit along a ridgeline hikers are treated to dramatic views of the Cascade mountains.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The lookout cabin is a 15 x 15 room, set 53 feet above the ground.
