    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Historic Aspen Cabin is nestled in a forest of fir, pine, and aspen, and provides an ideal setting for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in the Fremont-Winema National Forest. It was built in 1930 and originally used as an administrative cabin and fire guard station by U.S. Forest Service employees. <br /><br />It also served as a warming shelter for snowmobilers and cross-country skiers during the 1990s. Today, the cabin offers guests a secluded getaway in a landscape abundant with wildlife and nature.<br /><br /> Although the cabin provides some amenities to those seeking a comfortable lodging experience, guests must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Fremont National Forest  is known for its towering snow-capped peaks, volcanic landscapes, wide-open sage basins, scenic vistas and wild places, where guests can still find solitude.<br /><br />The area around the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk and squirrels. For birders to the area, sparrows, jays, sandhill cranes and woodpeckers find habitat in nearby ecosystems.<br /><br /> Indian paintbrush, camas, wild lilies and other wildflowers add splashes of color to the forested landscape.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Aspen Cabin is a wonderful location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and biking in summer and early fall. In the winter months, guests can take advantage of skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.<br /><br />Hikers will find scenic trails near the cabin, including Crane Mountain National Recreation Trail, located 3 miles to the southwest and at the Walker Trailhead. The Drake McDowell Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized Area is just 2 miles to the east.  <h4>Facilities:</h4>The one-room cabin is designed to accommodate up to four people and is furnished with four cots, a dining table and chairs, countertop space for food preparation and a wood stove for heating. A picnic table and campfire ring are located outdoors, as well as a pit toilet.<br /><br /> There is no water on-site, so guests must bring a sufficient supply for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests may fill water jugs at Mud Creek Campground approximately 1.5 miles away. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, light source, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags.<br /><br /> The Forest Service does not provide firewood but there is ample down and dead wood in the surrounding area. Cutting down trees for firewood is prohibited.",
