    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Fish Lake Remount Depot Cabins sit at an altitude of 3,200 feet near the Santiam Pass Winter Recreation Area of the Willamette National Forest. These cabins were built in 1924 and are rustic, historic wood structures that include a dispatchers cabin, a springhouse shed, a garage/woodshed and a fire hose shelter. The commissary cabin and a supervisors cabin, known as the Hall House, are available as rentals either separately or together.<br /><br /> The compound was once used to house firefighters and corral horses. It is still used as a rest and resupply station by the Forest Service horsepacker heading in and out of Wilderness areas.<br /><br /> Guests must walk, cross-country ski or snowshoe approximately three-quarters of a mile to access the cabins from Lava Lake Sno-Park.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The compound is accessed by a trail that traverses through dense evergreen forest. From the cabins, guests can enjoy the view of Fish Lake and its forested shoreline. The lake is shallow in winter, but can dry up and turn into meadow in the summer. <br /><br />Willamette National Forest offers prime habitat for such species as Roosevelt elk, black bear, northern bald eagles, mule deer and bobcats, among other wildlife. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Seven sno-parks constituting the Santiam Pass Winter Recreation Area are within a 15-minute drive of the cabins, including Lava Lake Sno-Park and Ray BensonSno-Park. Areas around these Sno-Parks offer miles of non-motorized trail opportunities for skiers and snowshoers. Marked Nordic ski trails and snowmobile trails are found at the Lava Lake Sno-Park. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Two cabins are available for rental at this site from winter through early spring. The Hall House is a 3-room cabin featuring 2 bedrooms, a shared common room and a kitchen. The Commissary Cabin features a bedroom and kitchen.<br /><br />  Both cabins have the same amenities, which include a full-size bed with mattress, table with chairs, sofa, propane heating and cooking stoves, solar-powered lighting, basic cookware and kitchen utensils. An outhouse with pit toilet is located nearby.Neither cabin has water or electricity. Guests must bring their own water for drinking, cooking and washing.<br /><br />Items such as bedding, lanterns or flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, towels and an ice chest are not available. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving.",
