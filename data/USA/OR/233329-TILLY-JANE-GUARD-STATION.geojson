    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Tilly Jane Guard Station is an ideal getaway for individuals and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. It is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and provides shelter for warmth and an escape from the elements while participating in a variety of activities, specifically winter-related recreation. During the winter months it serves as a winter retreat for visitors hardy enough to access to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. <br /><br />Guests can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile, gently sloping road, or via the Tilly Jane Trail, which is roughly 2.5 miles with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended and travelers should be prepared for extreme weather conditions. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The guard station is located high on the northeast side of Mt. Hood on the Tilly Jane Ski Trail, at an elevation of 5,700 feet. It was built in 1934 and initially received seasonal use for back country access and fire protection. The cabin is one of five structures in the area, built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is part of the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District. The facility is operated and maintained by the Oregon Nordic Club, under a permit from the Forest Service.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors to the guard station enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, snowshoeing and cross country skiing, which can be done throughout a majority of the year due to high levels of snowfall in the area. Many trails exist in the area, prompting exploration. <br /><br />Above the tree line, visitors can catch a glimpse of Mt. Adams, Mt. Ranier and the Hood River Valley flanked by the dry high desert of eastern Oregon. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin provides a full kitchen and a platform with sleeping pads for up to eight people. It has propane lighting and a propane stove/oven, as well as cooking pots and utensils. A variety of seating is available, as well as a table and chairs. A fireplace provides heat and firewood is provided in an outdoor shelter adjacent to the cabin.<br /><br />In warmer months, a freshwater spring can be found not far from the cabin. Pots are provided within the A-frame to melt snow for drinking water. A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided.<br /><br />Guests will need to bring their own bedding, clothing, food, garbage bags and toilet paper. A variety of house rules exist, including proper closure of the cabin, which involves ensuring lights are off and shutters have all been correctly replaced. The cabin will need to be cleaned prior to leaving, dishes washed and everything in its place. Guests will also need to replenish a supply of wood and kindling for the next group. All food and garbage must be removed from the cabin.",

    "FacilityDirections": "From Hood River, Oregon, travel south on Highway 35 for 8.5 miles, past the Hood River Ranger Station. Look for the Cooper Spur Inn sign and turn right off Highway 35, just north of Olallie Trailhead, onto Forest Road 3510 and drive to Copper Spur Inn. Turn left at the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Road 3512. The first trailhead is just past the intersection with Forest Service Road 620, with parking on the right and the trail on the left side of the road. This is the trailhead that is used in the winter to ski to and from the cabin. Most visitors ski the Cloud Cap Road to the Tilly Jane Campground. <br /><br />The second trailhead is at the Tilly Jane Campground, at the end of the long, winding Cloud Cap Road 3512 and the short Spur Road 630. From the Tilly Jane Campground, take the Tilly Jane Trail 600B a short distance to its intersection with the Tilly Jane A-frame. <br /><br />The safest way to ski down is the Cloud Cap Road (Forest Service Road 3512). This can be a long (8.5 miles), miserable slog if there is soft snow. The Old Wagon Road shortens this distance by about 4 to 5 miles, but involves steep slopes in the upper section of the road. The shortest route and probably the safest in poor snow conditions is to walk down the Tilly Jane Ski Trail, a distance of 2.5 miles.",
