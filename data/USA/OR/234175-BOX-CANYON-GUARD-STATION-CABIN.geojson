It is located approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon in the Willamette National Forest.<br /><br /> The guard station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and used as a dwelling for fire guards. They were the smoke chasers, often riding on horseback through the tall timbers to the location spotted by the lookout tower guards. The first on the scene, they often tried to put out any fires they may have found on their own, or reported back for additional help.<br /><br /> The guard station is open from mid-June through the end of October and is easily accessible by car. Some creature comforts are already provided, but guests should beprepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.  <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Box Canyon Guard Station sits at the doorstep of the Three Sisters Wilderness, a range of major peaks.
