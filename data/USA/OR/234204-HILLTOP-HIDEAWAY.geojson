    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Hilltop Hideaway is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and also step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. The cabin is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups.<br /><br />The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are where visitors can stay overnight.<br /><br />Hilltop Hideaway is furthest uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at about 5,000 feet in elevation, on a hillside overlooking the expansive Umatilla National Forest near the North Fork John Day Wilderness. A grassy lawn in front leads to the other three cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. <br /><br />Birds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the Boreal owl. Black bear, elk and deer are among the native land mammals. <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/home/?cid=STELPRDB5309506>Click here</a> for bear safety.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests can hike on trails into the North Fork John Day Wilderness or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like berry picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The quaint little cabin sleeps four, has electric lights throughout and is heated with an oil heater. A picnic table and briquette grill is provided out back for outdoor barbecuing. Additional guests can pitch tents in the yard. There is an outhouse near the cabin available year-round.<br /><br />The interior features one bedroom, a bath with hot and cold water (in summer only), a kitchen and a living room. It is fully furnished with a bunkbed with queen-sized mattresses, dressers, a couch and a table and chairs. The kitchen is equipped with an electric stove and oven, refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster and a variety of cooking utensils like skillets, glasses, cups and silverware. Cleaning supplies are also provided. <br /><br />Water is available June through September only; there is no water or indoor plumbing from October to May. Instead, an outhouse is available for use. In these seasons, guests are asked to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to pack include food, bedding, a first aid kit, flashlight, matches and all other basic camping gear. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-hilltop-hideaway.shtml>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The cabin is located less than 6 miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel.",
