    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Ludlum House is situated at the base of a mixed-conifer forest at the confluence of Wheeler Creek and the Winchuck River in southwestern Oregon, offering guests a unique setting for recreation and relaxation.<br /><br />The house was rebuilt in 1999 as a near-replica of the original two-story Ludlum family vacation house. Mr. Ludlum, an oil-company executive, constructed the house in 1939, then sold the property to the Forest Service following World War II.<br /><br />The accessible home offers some of the amenities needed for a comfortable lodging experience, although guests will need to bring several of their own supplies to ensure a safe and enjoyable stay. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Ludlum House is somewhat secluded and surrounded by a towering old-growth forest, with an expanse of lawn stretching out before it. Within an 1.5 hour drive from the house, guests have access to the rugged southern Oregon and northern California coasts and further south, the <a href=http://www.nps.gov/redw/index.htm>Redwood National Park</a>.<br /><br />The nearby Winchuck River flows into the Pacific Ocean about 0.5 miles north of the Oregon and California border and approximately 5 miles south of Brookings, Oregon. Five major tributaries, Wheeler Creek, East Fork, Fourth of July Creek, Bear Creek and South Fork, make up the Winchuck River system. Mt. Emily, at 2,926 feet, is the highest point in the basin.<br /><br /> Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, including black-tailed deer and an occasional black bear, to squirrels and salmon. Sensitive wildlife species such as Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet are present in the watershed as well. These species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, wildlife viewing and fishing top the list of recreational opportunities in the area surrounding the Ludlum House.<br /><br /> Just steps away from the banks of the Winchuck River, the cabin provides fantastic fishing opportunities for Coho salmon, Chinook salmon, cutthroat trout and steelhead trout. The river is closed to fishing above the Wheeler Creek confluence to provide a refuge for wild fish, but anglers will some excellent steelhead waters below this point, including several miles on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. Standard winter steelhead tactics such as drift fishing, floating jigs, or swinging flies work well on this gravel and cobble-bottomed river. Flies such as spruce flies or bucktail streamers work well for sea-run cutthroat.<br /><br /> The Oregon Redwoods Trail provides a unique accessible hiking opportunity through a grove of majestic old-growth redwood trees. Guests will have the opportunity to learn about old-growth tree ecology, fire history, wildlife, and botany in the area along Peavine Ridge in the Winchuck River drainage.<br /><br />Redwood trees in this area represent the only coastal redwoods found in the Pacific Northwest Region, located at the limit of their northern range. The trail is an out/back design with a short loop at the far end, where a picnic stop is provided. A short wooden deck provides access to the inside of a hollowed redwood tree.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Ludlum House is two stories and features one room on a lower floor, and a three-quarter dividing wall upstairs. The first floor, porch and surrounding grounds are all accessible. Picnic tables and a campfire ring are located near the cabin, as well as an accessible vault toilet.<br /><br />While the house and grounds can accommodate up to 60 guests maximum, there are no beds. The house is minimally furnished with a table and chairs, a sink and food preparation counter and a wood stove. There is no firewood available at this site, visitors must bring their own.<br /><br />Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a light source (battery",
