    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Historic Currier Guard Station is nestled in a scattering of fir, pine and aspen, providing an ideal setting for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in the Fremont-Winema National Forest.<br /><br /> The guard station was named after a local ranch owner, and was constructed in 1933 as an out station for the Paisley Ranger District to house forest fire prevention and suppression crews in the field. Fire crews occupied the station seasonally until the early 1990s. Today, the cabin offers guests a secluded getaway in a landscape abundant with wildlife and nature.<br /><br /> Although the cabin provides some amenities for those seeking a comfortable lodging experience, guests must bring several of their own supplies.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Fremont National Forest is known for its towering snow-capped peaks, volcanic landscapes, wide-open sage basins, scenic vistas and wild places where visitors can still find solitude.<br /><br />Behind the cabin, an expanse of meadow stretches to meet the forests edge, providing a perfect habitat for a variety of wildlife. Red tail hawks perch in treetops looking for field mice. Meadowlarks, Stellers jays and hummingbirds also frequent the area. Larger mammals, such as deer and Rocky Mountain elk find homes in the forests.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Currier Guard Station is a wonderful location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and biking in summer and early fall. In the winter months, guest can take advantage of skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.<br /><br />The cabin is located one mile north of the Sycan Wild and Scenic River, a scenic spot for fly fishing. The river corridor winds from a steep canyon to broad meadows, containing a diversity of landforms, rocks and vegetation. Coniferous forests intermingle with riparian vegetation, and expanses of sage and bitterbrush grow in the drier areas. The river supports rainbow, brook, brown and bull trout.<br /><br />Hikers and equestrians will enjoy numerous trails threading through the forest.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 450 square-foot cabin has two rooms and can accommodate up to four people. The combination bedroom/living room is furnished with a set of bunk beds, a double bed and propane heating stove. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs and a propane cook stove. A picnic table and campfire ring are provided for outdoor cooking, dining and campfires. A vault toilet is located near the cabin.<br /><br /> There is no water on site, so guests must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Although propane lighting is available, guests are advised to bring an additional light source in case of emergencies. The Forest Service provides firewood collected from blown-down branches and trees.",
