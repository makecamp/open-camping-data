    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cottonwood Cabin is located in central Washingtons Entiat Valley, on the banks of the Entiat River at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Constructed in the 1940s as administrative housing, the facility and on-site barn and corral were used seasonally by fire, trail and campground crew personnel.<br /><br />Today the cabin offers visitors a wonderful setting for recreation and relaxation from June through November in the forested mountain terrain of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The cabin can be accessed by standard passenger vehicles over gravel roads.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old growth forest, and rugged shrub-steppe country.<br /><br />Nestled in a mature lodgepole pine and spruce forest, the area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, pine marten, native fish, black bears, mountain lions and migratory birds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests at Cottonwood Cabin will find that the surrounding area offers opportunities to hike, fish, bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year.<br /><br /> Anglers will enjoy casting a line into the Entiat River above Entiat Falls. The cabin is located four miles above the falls. Carving through a wide, U-shaped valley, the river is dominated by relatively shallow riffles interspersed with pools, plunge pools and glides where the trout fishing is quite good. Populations of rainbow trout, Cutthroat trout, and Eastern brook trout are found in this tributary.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The one room cabin (20 x 16) can accommodate four people at a time. Amenities include hot and cold running water (summer months only), propane cook stove, wall heater, refrigerator, and LED lights.<br /><br />Furnishings include a dining table, lounge chair, futon sofa that coverts to a double bed, and a separate double bed. The small kitchen area is supplied with basic pots, pans, silverware and plates.<br /><br /> Outdoors, a private shower facility, picnic table, campfire ring, grill, and pit toilet are provided. An area for pitching one tent is also on site. Wood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed.<br /><br />Guests must bring several of their own amenities as the cabin does not provide food, sleeping bags/bedding, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper or garbage bags.  <br /><br /> The water and light system are solar powered. Although lighting is provided, visitors are encouraged to bring an additional light source. Water is also available via a hand pump during the summer months.<br /><br />Use of the stock corral is available for $20/night. A maximum of four head is permitted. A stock tank and feed bunk are provided. Visitors are required to bring their own weed free hay or pellet style feed for their livestock, and the corral must be reserved in advance through the Entiat Ranger Station at (509) 784-4700. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Take some time to visit Mount Rainer National Park, which offers a fantastic glimpse into glaciers, subalpine ecology, and volcanic landscapes typical in the region.<br /><br /> Nearby silver Falls Trail is a 1.8 mile hike beneath towering cedar and pines, along Silver Creek to the base of Silver Falls. Along the way, hikers are treated to views of the 141-foot cascade, as well as the Entiat valley below, and the mountains above.  Beautiful stone staircases and bridges along the trail offer many stopping points to take the perfect photograph.<br /><br />Coopers Store and Cafe in Ardenvoir, approximately 28 miles down valley, is the nearest source of gasoline, groceries, miscellaneous camping supplies and telephone services.",
