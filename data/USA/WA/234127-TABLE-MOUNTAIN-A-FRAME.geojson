    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>At an elevation of over 6,000 feet, Table Mountain A-Frame is nestled in a forest of subalpine fir, lodgepole pine and Englemann spruce, offering guests a unique lodging opportunity in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Built in the 1960s, the cabin was originally used under permit by the Boeing Company to test electronic gear at higher elevations. The structure came into Forest Service ownership when the companys special permit ended.<br /><br />The cabin is available July through mid-October, and is accessible by car at that time. It is also available from mid-December through early April, and guests must park at the Blewett Pass Sno-Park and snowmobile, ski or snowshoe 7.5 miles to the cabin with a 2,200 foot elevation gain. Some amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to bring several of their own supplies. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old-growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country.<br /><br />Nestled in a subalpine forest, the area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, squirrels and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl and gray wolf, also find havens in nearby ecosystems.<br /><br />Mount Stuart, a towering mass of granite located in the nearby Alpine Lakes Wilderness, can be seen from the area. At an elevation of 9,415 feet, it is the second highest non-volcanic peak in Washington. Its steep summit stands out among its neighboring peaks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and mountain biking in summer and early fall, guests can take advantage of skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.<br /><br />Table Mountain, with its high elevation and great distance from cities and light pollution, is revered by West Coast astronomers as a stargazing paradise. Every summer, hundreds of astronomers flock to the area in the early part of August to attend the Table Mountain Star Party.<br /><br />Hikers may enjoy Naneum Meadows Trail, which is less than three miles from the cabin. This loop links lush meadows, cliff-top views and scores of wildflowers in the summer months. In the winter, trail users should have knowledge of avalanche safety, as well as route finding and ski mountaineering skills.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The two-story A-frame cabin features a large living room and kitchen area downstairs, and a loft upstairs. The cabin is suitable for groups up to ten, but there are only two bunk beds downstairs and two twin beds in the loft, all with mattresses. The cabin is equipped with a Coleman propane cook stove that uses 16.4 ounce propane cylinders and a lantern that uses 4 D batteries. Guests must provide their own fuel and batteries. The stove must be taken outside for use. No stove or open flames are allowed in the cabin.<br /><br />A wood stove heats the cabin; however, wood is only supplied in the winter and must be split. An axe, splitting maul and wedge are available for guest use. A vault toilet, picnic table and fire pit are located outside the cabin. Shovels are located in the cabin for clearing snow.<br /><br />There is no water or electricity available at the site.  Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing.<br /><br /> Other items to bring include sleeping bags, backup light sources, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.",
