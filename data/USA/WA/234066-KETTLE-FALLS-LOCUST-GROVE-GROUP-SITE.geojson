    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kettle Falls Locust Grove Group Site is on the northern section of Lake Roosevelt and convenient to the town of Kettle Falls. The facility is 0.25 miles away from the main Kettle Falls Campground, which has a multi-lane boat launch. It is popular for groups of boaters, fishermen and water sports enthusiasts. The Kettle Falls area is rich in history of American Indians as well as the fur trade; campers can learn more at a park visitor center less than 10 miles away.<br /><br />Lake Roosevelt is a 130-mile lake on the Columbia River created by the Grand Coulee Dam. Named after President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it is part of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and managed by the National Park Service.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The actual waterfalls of Kettle Falls are dormant under 80 feet of water formed by the backwaters of Grand Coulee Dam. The two group sites are spacious and set within a grove of locust trees, hence the name. They are near the site of Old Kettle Falls and overlooking Lake Roosevelt. Much of the water originates from glaciers and snow in the cold, high Canadian Rockies, though temperatures warm up in summer. The lake area is abundant with wildlife, including moose, elk, deer and bald eagles. Dozens of species of fish inhabit the lake, such as walleye, bass, rainbow trout, salmon and sturgeon. Fishing for sturgeon is not allowed.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The boat launch is in the main campground adjacent to the group sites, making the lake very accessible for boaters and fishermen. There is a former swimming beach at the group area; however, swimming conditions are not ideal.<h4>Facilities:</h4>There are two group sites at this facility, which are only a short walk or drive away from the main campground. It is conveniently located near the town of Kettle Falls and within 10 minutes of grocery stores and other amenities. The visitor center is also in town.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The historic St. Pauls Mission, which is run by the National Park Service, is located about two miles from campground. Also in the area are Fort Colville and the Hudson Bay Company Post on the Upper Columbia, as well as the Sherman Pass Loop scenic drive.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.nps.gov/laro/historyculture/mission-point.htm target=_blank>St. Pauls Mission</a>",
