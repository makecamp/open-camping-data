    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>American Ridge Lodge is located approximately 38 miles west of Naches, Washington in the foothills of the eastern Cascades. The lodge is available for reservation year-round, offering visitors a glimpse into the unique ski history of the area. Larger groups and gatherings will find this spacious facility to be an ideal setting for recreation and relaxation.<br /><br /> In the 1930s, the Yakima Valley Ski Club worked with the U.S. Forest Service to construct the American River Ski Bowl, one of the first downhill ski areas in Washington State. The rustic ski lodge and unique 20-seater outhouse were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in connection with the ski area, which was operated into the 1950s.<br /><br />  By the late 1950s, White Pass Ski Area was built, offering deeper snow, a longer ski season and steeper slopes. American Ridge Ski Bowl lay vacant for years, until the lodge and outhouse were carefully restored and made available to the public for reservation.  <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The lodge is located just outside the boundary of the William O. Douglas Wilderness, at an elevation of 3,041 feet. Defined by 166,000 acres of snow-capped peaks, rocky ridges, steep slopes and hundreds of pools and lakes, this magnificent region pays tribute to wilderness advocate and Supreme Court justice, William Orville Douglas, who often explored the area on foot.<br /><br /> Wildlife viewing is plentiful in the areas surrounding the lodge. Large herds of elk and mule deer may cross the landscape, sharing forest habitat with black bear, squirrels and grouse.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In the summer and early fall, guests will find excellent hiking, fishing, horseback riding, and mountain biking opportunities in the area. Skiing, snowshoeing, sledding and snowmobiling are available in the winter months. <br /><br />Additionally, hundreds of small pools, ponds, rivers and lakes are home to populations of brook, rainbow and cutthroat trout, as well as salmon, drawing anglers from all over. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The rustic and spacious 43 x 48 foot lodge, although largely unfurnished, is equipped with a kitchen area, counter space and benches, several closets and cabinets, and a wood stove.<br /><br /> Outside, there is a fire ring and picnic tables, as well as plenty of room on the grounds for dispersed camping, making it an ideal location for groups. There are no beds at this facility. Visitors must supply their own wood for the wood stove and fire ring.<br /><br /> The lodge does not have water or electricity on site, but pitcher pump water is available during the summer months from Cedar Springs Campground located approximately 1.5 miles from the site. In the fall, winter and spring, visitors must bring plenty of their own water for drinking, cooking and washing.<br /><br />Visitors must also bring their own light source. Battery powered lanterns are suggested and guests are asked to respect the facilitys open flame policy, which prohibits the use of all open flame devises such as propane stoves, gas lanterns and candles, while inside the lodge.<br /><br /> Sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags are not available at the lodge, and must be brought by guests to the lodge. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Hikers may want to traverse a portion of the spectacular <a href=http://www.pcta.org/>Pacific Crest Trail (PCT)</a>, one of the worlds premier National Scenic Trails. Enjoy some of North Americas most fantastic scenery, as the trail winds from Mexico to Canada through Washington state. <br /><br /> <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/okawen/recarea/?recid=58133>Boulder Cave Trail</a> is one of the most popular places in the Naches District.
