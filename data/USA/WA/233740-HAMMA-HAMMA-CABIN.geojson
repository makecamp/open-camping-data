    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Hamma Hamma Cabin is a historic cabin that offers guests a tranquil setting to relax and recreate. Formerly a guard station, the cabin was built from 1936-1937 bythe Civilian Conservation Corps. The facility was used as an administrative site for Forest Service fire and trail crews. The site is nominated to the National Register of Historic Places for the skill and craftsmanship that went into its construction and architecture.<br /><br /> The cabin is open year-round and is typically accessible by car; however, snowy conditions require alternative transportation such as cross-country skis or snowshoes. Many amenitiesare offered, so guests only need to bring a few of their own supplies for an enjoyable stay. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Hamma Hamma Cabin sits on a landscaped clearing surrounded by old-growth Douglas firs, dogwoods and rhododendrons. The scenic Hamma Hamma River flows nearby, which isfed by the Mildred Lakes within the Mt. Skokomish Wilderness and drops from the eastern slope of the Olympic Range into the Hood Canal. The name Hamma Hamma comes from a Twana village once located at the rivers mouth and called Habhab, referring to a reed that grows along the rivers banks.<br /><br />Mt. Skokomish Wilderness, located in the southeast corner of Olympic National Forest, is accessible from the area. Bold rocky summits and numerous sharp spires dot the ridges at elevations ranging from 2,000 to over 6,000 feet.<br /><br />Magnificent old-growth western hemlock, western red cedar and Douglas fir dominate the forest in the lower elevations, providing habitat for elk, black-tailed deer, black bears and mountain lions. Higher elevations display firs, pines, dwarf juniper and open rock faces that are home to marmots and mountain goats.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hamma Hamma Cabin is conveniently located near The Brothers Wilderness, Mt. Skokomish Wilderness, Hood Canal and Olympic National Park. Numerous activities, such as hiking, mountain climbing, fishing, hunting and river walks are available in the area.<br /><br />From Hamma Hamma Cabin, guests can wander the Living Legecy Trail, an interpretive trail that details the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps. At only a quarter mile, the trail offers a scenic, open view of the Hamma Hamma River. In the spring, Harlequin ducks arrive from the sea to nest in this freshwater spot. Lena Lake Trail #810 offers a great hike a few miles west of the cabin.<br /><br />Anglers will enjoy fishing the scenic Hamma Hamma River for chum, pink, chinook, coho and steelhead.<br /><br />The scenic Hamma Hamma Falls are a popular recreational destination, cascading 75 feet into a spectacular gorge.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Hamma Hamma Cabin can accommodate up to six guests. The single-story cabin features a living room with a hexagonal bay window overlooking the Hamma Hamma River drainage, and is furnished with a futon that unfolds into a bed. There are two bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with bunk beds, all with mattresses. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, stove, refrigerator, dishes, pots, silverware and cooking utensils. The bathroom has a flush toilet.<br /><br /> The cabin is equipped with a propane heater and propane lights. An outdoor picnic table, fire ring and pedestal barbeque grill are available for cooking and campfires.<br /><br />Drinking water is not available.
