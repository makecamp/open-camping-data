    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>At an elevation of 2,500 feet, Mineral Springs Group Campground sits in the mountainous terrain of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in northern Washington.<br /><br />  Nearby peaks, high-country lakes and old-growth forests provide visitors with a variety of scenic landscapes.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest features high, glaciated alpine peaks towering along the Cascade Crest. Lush valleys of old growth forest define its western boundary, and at its eastern edge, rugged shrub-steppe country comprises a more arid region.<br /><br />  Mount Stuart, a towering mass of granite located in the nearby Alpine Lakes Wilderness area, is the second highest non-volcanic peak in Washington, perched at an elevation of 9,415 feet.<br /><br />The surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support an abundance of wildlife, including deer, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Bald Eagle, the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves and grizzly bears,  also find havens in nearby ecosystems.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and mountain biking in summer and early fall, Mineral Springs offers excellent skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the winter months.<br /><br />The campground is a great base camp for day-hikers and overnight backpackers, and several access trails are available from the area.<br /><br /> Climbing the nearby Red Top Mountain is a popular excursion for families with children or for those wanting to reach a summit within a half-day. Red Top Trail is a steep, short traverse at 2.5 miles round-trip, gaining 350 feet in elevation in less than a mile. Perched atop the mountain is Red Mountain Lookout, and on a clear day visitors are treated to views of Mt. Rainier, the Stuart Range and the Teanaway and Cle Elum valleys.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Mineral Spring Campground offers one large group site that can accommodate up to 50 guests. The site is equipped with tables and campfire rings with grills. Vault toilets and drinking water are also available on site. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt. Rainer National Parks, where interpretive programs and exhibits offer education about the diverse landscape and history of the area.<br /><br />The spectacular Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the worlds premier National Scenic Trails, showcases some of North Americas most fantastic scenery, winding its way its way from Mexico to Canada through California, Oregon and Washington, and is accessible near the campground.",
