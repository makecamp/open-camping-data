    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Beneath a canopy of pine and fir on the banks of Chatter Creek, this campground offers a serene setting for groups and large gatherings.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic views, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape. Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to over 9,000 feet.<br /><br />  Precipitation varies greatly throughout the area, ranging from approximately 140 inches along the Cascade Crest to only 10 inches along the eastern edge. Visitors can expect many days of warm, sunny weather in the summer, and winters with clear skies and plenty of snow.<br /><br />More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades, and many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and grasses.<br /><br /> Congress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres. Prior to designation, aggressive mining and logging operations punched numerous access roads into the area, creating a wildly irregular boundary to this popular area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Chatter Creek Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, ski and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year.<br /><br /> Anglers may want to cast a line into the pools lining the pebble-strewn shore of Chatter Creek. A variety of trout populations find habitat along the banks of this quaint creek.<br /><br />  The trailhead for Icicle Gorge Loop Trail is close to camp. This valley-bottom trail has easy grades along both sides of Icicle Creek. On the other hand, Chatter Creek Trail, also nearby, offers a challenging steep trail with thick underbrush.<br /><br />Skiing, snowmobiling, tubing and skijouring are popular winter activities for visitors to the Wenatchee Ranger District. Both motorized and non-motorized Sno-Parks in the area offer access to both groomed trails and natural settings for those wanting to explore the winter wonderland.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Chatter Creek Group Campground has one large site that can accommodate up to 45 people and 12 vehicles. The site is equipped with picnic tables, a group campfire ring, drinking water and accessible vault toilets.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Bavarian-themed town of Leavenworth provides wonderful opportunities for shopping, dining, and exploring its unique history.<br /><br />Visitors may want to take some time to visit nearby Mount Rainer National Park.  Considered a wonderland, the park offers a fantasic glimpse into glaciers, subalpine ecology, and volcanic landscapes typical in the region.<br /><br /> Goat Rocks Wilderness is a stunning adventure for those wanting to traverse higher elevations. Peaks within the area are remnants of an extinct volcano, taking the name &quot;Goat Rocks,&quot; in honor of the numerous mountain goats traversing this isolated region.  Gilbert Peak is the highest summit in this area at an elevation of 8,184 feet.",
