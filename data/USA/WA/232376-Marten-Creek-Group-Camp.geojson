    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Visitors traversing the scenic Mountain Loop Road through Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest will find Marten Creek Group Campground.<br /><br />Located on a forested bench above the confluence of the tranquil Stillaguamish River and Marten Creek, this campground is in close proximity to several wilderness areas and a handful of hiking trails, offering visitors opportunities to experience both the serene and wild aspects of the Cascade region. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to explore the regions rugged peaks, scenic rivers and interesting wildlife that comprise the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.<br /><br /> Old-growth forests of cedar, fir, and hemlock line the wide, gently-flowing Stillaguamish River, and tower over trails winding through moss-covered rocks.<br /><br /> On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Bakers summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br /><br /> In addition to being home for a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine. Grizzly bear sightings have been confirmed in the Cascade region, though black bears are more common.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking, and horseback riding in summer and early fall, Marten Creek offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.<br /><br />Anglers will enjoy fishing from the gently-flowing Stillaguamish River. The Stillaguamish sustains a large salmon and trout population including chinook, coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Marten Creek Campground sits snug between the Mt. Loop Scenic Byway and the Stillaguamish River. It can accommodate up to 25 guests.There is traffic noise, so it is not the best location for tent camping.<br /><br />   The site is equipped with tables and campfire rings with grills.
