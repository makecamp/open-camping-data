    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The Taneum Cabin is located in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, approximately 20 miles from Ellensburg, Washington. The cabin is available for reservation from Memorial Day through Labor Day, offering guests a wonderful setting for recreation and relaxation.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible by car and provides many of the same comforts of home. Guests only need to bring a few of their own amenities for an enjoyable stay.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old-growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country.<br /><br />Nestled in pine and cottonwood along Taneum Creek, the area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, squirrels and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl, gray wolf and grizzly bear, also find havens in nearby ecosystems.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests at Taneum Cabin will find that the cabin is in a prime location for hiking, fishing, horseback riding and mountain biking in summer. Off-road vehicles, particularly motorbikes, share nearby trails with hikers and mountain bikers.<br /><br />Anglers will enjoy casting a line into Taneum Creek near the cabin. The creek is not particularly big, but flows through Forest Service lands, providing good opportunities for catching fair-sized trout in June and July.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The rustic four-room log cabin is furnished with a queen-sized bed with mattress and a standard pull-out sofa with mattress. Amenities include a heater, lights, refrigerator and range, all powered by propane fuel available at the cabin. The kitchen is supplied with cooking utensils and cookware. A wood stove provides heat for the cabin. An inside bathroom with a sink, flush toilet and shower are available.<br /><br /> Outdoors, guests can enjoy relaxing outside at a picnic table or around a campfire ring. Wood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed. A small campground is located about a quarter mile from the cabin.<br /><br />Guests should bring sleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper, garbage bags and an additional light source. All trash and food must be packed out, and trashcan be disposed of at the nearby campground. Guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<br /><br />",
