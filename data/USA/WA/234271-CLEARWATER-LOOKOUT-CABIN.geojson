    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Clearwater Lookout Cabin is a single story, wood frame structure constructed in 1935. It is tucked at the base of the Clearwater Lookout tower, a 94-foot steel tower constructed by the Civil Conservation Corps in 1933. Through the years, the tower has been used as a landmark by the public and employees of the Forest Service. The tower is no longer manned during fire season, but it is used on occasion during extreme fire conditions. The tower is closed to public access, but the rental cabin is open year-round.<br /><br />The cabin is located about 25 miles south of Pomeroy, Washington in the Umatilla National Forest. Access by car is from June 1 to November 1. In winter, access is limited to cross country skis, snowshoes or snowmobile.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Perched at 5,600 feet elevation, Clearwater Lookout Cabin offers panoramic views of the expansive Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness, from sunrise to sunset.<br /><br />The rugged landscape of the wilderness stretches across the northern Blue Mountains of southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. The mountain slopes are carpeted with bunchgrass, lodgepole pine and subalpine fir.<br /><br />An array of wildlife, including Rocky Mountain Elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed and mule deer, black bears, cougars and coyotes may be spotted.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Horseback riding and hiking trails can be accessed from the cabin. During spring and summer, guests can enjoy a short and scenic drive along the Tucannon River to Sunset Point. Mushroom and berry picking may also entertain guests. At night, guests enjoy gazing up at the star-filled sky.<br /><br />Winter brings avid snowmobilers and skiers to explore its groomed trails. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is divided into a kitchen and a bedroom, and is furnished with two double beds and two single beds. It is kept warm in the winter by a propane heater, and features propane lights, a cook stove and a refrigerator, as well as some cookware, dishes and utensils. It is suggested that visitors bring their own dishes, pots, pans and utensils, however. An outhouse is located nearby. <br /><br />There is no water on-site, so visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. Other things to bring include bedding or sleeping bags, flashlights, dish soap and other basic camping gear. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-clearwater-lo-cabin.shtml>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest general stores and gas stations are in Pomeroy, a 40-minute drive from the cabin.",
