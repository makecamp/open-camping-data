    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The historic Tucannon Guard Station is a charming saltbox-style cabin constructed in 1909. It was inhabited by the first ranger in the Tucannon area, William Kendell, and his family. By 1916, the guard house became headquarters for the district for two years, and then continued on as a standard guard station.<br /><br />Staying here is like stepping back in time. The rooms inside are nicely decorated and cozy. Touches like curtains on the windows and modern furniture add to the destination experience. Beyond the cabin is plenty of photogenic scenery, plus options for prime fishing and hiking. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is perched on a shady, gently rolling site at the base of a hillside in Tucannon Valley. The rugged landscape stretches across the northern Blue Mountains of southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. <br /><br />Visitors may spot local inhabitants like wild turkey, pheasant, deer, elk and even an occasional moose in the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Just a few miles south are trailheads to wilderness hiking trails. Plus the road along the Tucannon River is a notable scenic drive, ideal for viewing flora and fauna. <br /><br />Historic Target Meadows is also nearby, where military cavalry in the 1800s held shooting practice. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Tucannon is a two-story wood frame structure with wood siding and a shake shingle roof. The upstairs is divided into two sleeping areas, one furnished with bunkbeds and the other with a double bed. The ground floor has one bedroom and a living room furnished with a futon that sleeps two. The downstairs bathroom is equipped with a flush toilet and shower with hot water.<br /><br />Electricity and propane are included for heating and cooking. The kitchen and dining area boast a cook stove and refrigerator, plus a table and chairs.The cabin has running water year round and it is potable. A picnic table sits outside beneath the trees.<br /><br />Most cleaning supplies, dishes, pots, pans and utensils are provided, but visitors are encouraged to bring their own. Guests should also bring bedding or sleeping bags, and basic camping gear like flashlights, dish soap and matches. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-tucannon-gs.shtml>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>A convenience store, gas station and RV park is located about 9 miles, or 15 minutes, north of the cabin.",
