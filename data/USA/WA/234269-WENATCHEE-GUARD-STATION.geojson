    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Wenatchee Guard Station, located about 40 miles southeast of Pomeroy, offers a panoramic view of Wenatchee Creek and access to a scenic drive along Wenatchee Creek Canyon. The year-round cabin attracts cross country skiers and snowmobilers in winter and horseback riders and hikers in summer. Dogs and horses are allowed at the cabin.   <br /><br />As early as the 1910s, the site was used as a Forest Guard Camp. In 1927, a log cabin was built and used until it was replaced with the current guard station, completed in 1935 by the Civil Conservation Corps.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Wenatchee Guard Station sits in a grassy clearing on a high plateau dotted with mixed conifers, offering majestic views of the northern tip of the Blue Mountains. In the spring, wildflowers, such as yarrow, Pipers anemone, Big-leaf sandwort, Showy Aster, Camas pink fairy, daisy and sagebrush sweep color down the slopes into the valleys.<br /><br />Campers enjoy the view of Grouse Flats and look for herds of Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer and white-tailed deer. They can also listen for the call of geese, ducks, hawks, grouse, wild turkeys, screech owls and wrens.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Horseback riding and hiking trails can be accessed from the cabin. Another way to enjoy views along Wenatchee Creek is by taking a scenic drive. Berry and mushroom picking is possible, and in winter, trails are groomed for snowmobiling and cross country skiing. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The wood-framed, single story cabin accommodates up to four people. It features a kitchen, bedroom and living room that also serves as a bedroom. Furnishings include two single beds, a double bed, chairs and a table. <br /><br />The cabin is equipped with propane for heat, a cook stove, refrigerator and propane lighting. Most cleaning supplies, limited dishes, pots, pans and utensils are provided. However, it is strongly suggested visitors bring their own. Water is not available on-site. An outhouse is located nearby. Though horses are allowed, there is no corral. <br /><br />Things to bring include food, water, sleeping bags or bedding, a flashlight, matches, first aid kit, trash bags, towels and washcloths. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-wenatchee-gs.shtml#amenities>Click here</a>) for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The cabin is about an hour from any general store. The town of Pomeroy has a county museum, art gallery and antiques.",
