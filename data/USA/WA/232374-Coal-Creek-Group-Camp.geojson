Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.<br /><br />Surrounded by stands of old-growth forest and located near the confluence the of the tranquil Stillaguamish River and bubbling Coal Creek, this site is ideal for small group or family camping excursions. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Located in the majestic Cascade region of Washington, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, scenic rivers and lush forests.<br /><br />  The banks of the Stillaguamish River are lined with old-growth forests of cedar, fir and hemlock.<br /><br />   On a clear day visitors can spot Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt.

In addition to being home for a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine. Grizzly bear sightings have been confirmed in the Cascade region, though black bear sightings are more common.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Coal Creek is a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall, and offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.<br /><br />Hikers may want to explore the nearby Big Four Ice Caves Trail off of the Mountain Loop Highway.
