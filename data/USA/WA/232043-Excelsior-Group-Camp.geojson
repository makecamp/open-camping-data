    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Located near the banks of the Nooksack River in Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, approximately five miles south of the Canadian border, Excelsior Group Camp offers stunning scenery and access to numerous recreational activities popular in the Northern Cascade Range.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests.<br /><br />On a clear day visitors can spot Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, this active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Bakers summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br /><br />From the high snowfields and glaciers of Mt. Baker, Mt.Shuksan and the Twin Sisters range in the North Cascades, the Nooksack River system provides habitat for many species to survive. Wildlife in the area includes a variety of salmon species, elk, bald eagle and cougar. Migratory birds and an occasional black bear find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The area surrounding the campground is prime location for hiking, fishing and picnicking in summer and early fall.<br /><br />  Hikers and backpackers are especially fortunate to have access to a variety of trails near the campground and in the surrounding areas.<br /><br />Horseshoe Bend Trail is an easy forest hike along the Mt. Baker Scenic Byway, highlighting old-growth forests, gushing whitewater rapids and forest wildflowers. The trail follows the North Fork of the Nooksack River upstream to a stunning view of East Church Mountain. The trailhead can be accessed from the nearby Douglas Fir campground.<br /><br />Another popular hike in the Mt. Baker Ranger District is the Skyline Divide Trail. This trail climbs steadily for two miles through forest into lush, open, flower-filled meadows with stellar views of glacier-draped Mt. Baker. The trail then wanders along Skyline Divide for another 1.5 miles, offering views of rivers, forests and countless peaks. <h4>Facilities:</h4>There are two large group sites in the campground. Site A will sleep 50 people and has 6 picnic tables with fire pits. Site B accommodates 50 people and has 15 tables with fire pits. Vault toilets are also provided.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt. Rainer National Parks, where interpretive programs and exhibits offer education about the diverse landscape and history of the area.<br /><br />The spectacular Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the worlds premier National Scenic Trails, showcases some of North Americas most fantastic scenery, winding its way its way from Mexico to Canada through California, Oregon and Washington, and is accessible near the campground.",
