    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Interrorem Cabin is located beneath magnificent stands of old-growth forest and hardwood trees, offering guests an ideal location for relaxation and recreation in Olympic National Forest. The cabin was built in 1907 as the first administrative site in the Olympic National Forest. Emery J. Finch, Ranger and Hoodsport pioneer, built the cabin for his new bride, Mabel, and they moved in on April 22, 1908.<br /><br />Between the years 1933 and 1942, the station hosted several government programs such as the Emergency Relief Administration, Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. From 1942 to 1986, the cabin was a fireguard station, and from 1986 to 1994, it was used by Forest Service volunteers.<br /><br /> Today, the site offers guests a unique and comfortable lodging experience year-round in Olympic National Forest. The cabin is accessible by car. Many amenities are offered, but guests will have to bring some of their own supplies and gear.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Interrorem Cabin sits on a grassy clearing located in the Duckabush Recreation Area, with nearby access to the Duckabush River, The Brothers Wilderness, Olympic National Park and Hood Canal.<br /><br />The Brothers Wilderness is located in the eastern portion of the Olympic National Forest just south of Buckhorn Wilderness and north of Mt. Skokomish Wilderness. The Dosewallips and Hamma Hamma Rivers run cold and clear, bordering the area. At 6,866 feet, The Brothers is the highest peak in the area, with a double summit that ranks among the most popular climbs in the Olympics.<br /><br />Near the cabin, western hemlock, western red cedar and Douglas fir dominate the dense forest, providing habitat for elk, black-tailed deer, black bears and mountain lions. Higher elevations are home to marmots and mountain goats.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A nature trail with interpretive signs and historic photos that describe the life of Emery and Mabel Finch is located behind the cabin. Mr. Finch, an avid fisherman, was responsible for building the Ranger Hole Trail, a path to his favorite fishing spot on the Duckabush River. A few trout and some wonderful views of the river can be caught here. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The historic 24x20-foot one-story cabin is a square, peeled-log building and includes an open porch across its facade and a pyramidal cedar shake roof. It can accommodate up to four guests. The kitchen is furnished with a table and chairs, cookware, utensils, propane cook range, refrigerator and lights. The living room has a futon and the bedroom has twin bunk beds. A propane heater keeps it cozy during the winter months. Propane is furnished.<br /><br /> Potable water is available from an outdoor hand pump. During camping season (mid-June through September), potable water is also available from a hand pump at Collins Campground, one mile west on Forest Service Road 2510. An outhouse with vault toilet, fire ring and picnic table are located on the cabin grounds.<br /><br />No electricity or indoor plumbing is available at this facility. Guests need to provide their own sleeping bags, pillows, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Take some time to visit Olympic National Park, known for its diverse and spectacular ecosystems.",
