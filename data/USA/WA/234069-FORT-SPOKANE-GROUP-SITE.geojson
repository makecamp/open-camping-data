    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Fort Spokane Group Campground is a great destination for history buffs, birders and boaters and the perfect location for groups who like to experience a combination of history and recreation. The facility lies on the shoreline of Lake Roosevelt next to the grounds of a former military fort constructed to keep the peace between early settlers and the American Indians.<br /><br />Visitors can spend a few hours learning about the fort and Indian boarding school by taking a stroll to the museum across the street. Visitors can also enjoy boating, fishing, birding or taking in the scenery around the lake. <br /><br />Lake Roosevelt is a 130-mile lake of the Columbia River created by the Grand Coulee Dam. Named after President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it is part of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and managed by the National Park Service.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Fort Spokane lies on the water amidst ponderosa pine trees and shrubs. It is near the confluence of the Spokane River and the Columbia River. The lake has comfortable temperatures during summer, even though much of the water originates from glaciers and snowmelt in the cold, high Canadian Rockies. The lake area is abundant with wildlife, including moose, elk, deer, bighorn sheep, birds and fish.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Fort Spokane boasts some of the best bird habitats in the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The prime viewing spot is Hawk Creek, only a few miles away. Birders often see peregrine falcons, blue herons, finches, bald eagles, osprey and even the occasional golden eagle.<br /><br />The former guard house of the fort is still standing and has been converted to a visitor center and museum directly across the street from the campground. The center is open from June through Labor Day, during which visitors can learn about the military history and Indian boarding school through interpretive programs and exhibits. For a self-guided tour, there is an interpretive trail. <br /><br />The lake is abundant with walleye, bass, rainbow trout and salmon, making it a popular place for fishing throughout the year; the shoreline along Fort Spokane does not typically freeze in winter and the campgrounds boat launch is open all year.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Fort Spokane Group Site represents the two group areas within the general Fort Spokane Campground that can be reserved; the group and general campsites are separated by the boat launch. Each group site can hold up to 45 people. The campground is open year-round, however drinking water is shut off in winter. There are no hookups. A convenience store and gas station are nearby for campers to replenish basic goods.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The reservation of the Spokane Tribe of Indians is near the campground at the confluence of the Spokane and Columbia Rivers. There is a casino on the reservation.",
