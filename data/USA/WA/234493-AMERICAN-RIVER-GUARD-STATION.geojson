    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>American River Guard Station is located about 40 miles west of Naches, Washington on the banks of the American River in the eastern Cascade Mountains.<br /><br />The rustic cabin and outhouse were built by the men of the 932nd Camp Naches Civilian Conservation Corps crew in 1941 as a summer residence and work site for fire patrol and recreation management personnel.<br /><br />In the 1970s, volunteers and permit holders sporadically used the cabin, until it was found eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.<br /><br />  Today, the cabin, which is located in the heart of the central Cascades recreation area in eastern Washington off the scenic Mather Memorial Parkway, offers visitors a wonderful setting for year-round recreation and relaxation.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old growth forest, and rugged shrub-steppe country.<br /><br />  The American River Guard Station is nestled in a old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar understory with grassy areas, ferns and mosses.<br /><br />  With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, porcupine, native fish, and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems.

Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage. In winter, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing are popular in the American River area.<br /><br />The cabin is also conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of <a href=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/passes/chinook/>Chinook Pass</a> and <a href=http://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm>Mt. Rainer National Park</a> . A trip along the scenic <a href=http://byways.org/explore/byways/2226/itinerary/4029>Mather Parkway</a> is a fantastic outing.<br /><br />The American River, adjacent to the cabin, offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout.<br /><br /> Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries draining the Cascade region.   <h4>Facilities:</h4>The Depression-era rustic cabin is one and a half stories tall, with a wood frame and shake roof. It has a small kitchen, a living/sleeping area, one bedroom and a full sized sleeping loft and storage room. <br /><br />There is a queen size sleeper sofa in the living room, a full size bed and mattress in the bedroom and two twin size beds in the upstairs loft. Sleeping bags and sleeping pads are not provided.<br /><br /> The cabin is furnished with a dining table and chairs for four people (with hidden leaf to expand for eight people), a small refrigerator and an electric range. There is a wood stove, electric light fixtures and a living room electric baseboard heater. Guests should be aware that open flame devises such as propane stoves, gas lanterns, and candles are prohibited indoors. <br /><br />The kitchen is equipped with a coffee maker, pots, dishes and glassware, but guests must bring several of their own supplies including food, cooking utensils, dish soap, towels, matches, garbage bags and a first aid kit.  <br /><br />Outside, near the cabin, there is a picnic table and campfire ring.
