    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Set near the Suiattle River and surrounded by mountain peaks and old-growth forest, the Suiattle Guard Station (pronounced &quot;Sue-attle&quot;) is a historic log cabin that was constructed in 1913 by Tommy Thompson, Assistant Ranger of the Suiattle-Finney District, to house a forest guard.<br /><br /> Because of budget limitations at that time, the Forest Service often relied upon rangers to construct their own stations. It is a testament to Ranger Thompson`s skill that the cabin survives to this day as one of the oldest administrative buildings in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The Suiattle Guard Station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible by car. Many creature comforts are provided, but guests will need to bring a few of their own amenities to ensure a comfortable and enjoyablestay. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Hemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests. The charming log cabin sits on a gently sloping lawn at the edge of the forest.<br /><br />Nearby Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day.  Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Bakers summit, Grant Peak, is actually a mound of ice 1,300 feet deep, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br /><br />Wildlife is abundant, and guests may catch a glimpse of black bears, bobcats, elk or bald eagles. Wolves are making a comeback to the area, but they are usually heard and not seen. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Several hiking and equestrian trails crisscross the area, which are accessible from Suiattle River Road (Forest Service Road 26). Anglers can also find fishing spots nearby.<br /><br />Federally protected under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the Suiattle River is popular among whitewater enthusiasts. River runners paddle Class 2 and 3 rapids through lush forested scenery, with views of nearby snow-capped peaks. Since the headwaters of the river originate at a glacier, the water has a milky appearance. July and August are the best times for rafting.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can accommodate four people with one full size bed with mattress and one futon. Other amenities include a table, two benches, two chairs, a propane refrigerator, stove, lantern, cookware, dishes, utensils, water heater and a wood stove. A bathroom with a shower and flush toilet is located at the back of the guard station, and a primitive vault toilet is located 20 feet from the building. Firewood is available outside the cabin.<br /><br /> There is room on-site for up to four tents and two RVs. No electrical hook-ups are available. The water source to the building consists of a spring that is run into a small collection box on the hillside behind the cabin and piped into the building. This water is not drinkable and is to be used only for the toilet.<br /><br />  Drinking water is not available. Guests must bring enough water for drinking, cooking, and washing.<br /><br />Propane canisters are not provided for the lantern, so guests must bring their own propane canisters. Other items to bring include food, a backup light source, sleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean thecabin before leaving. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Darrington, located 26 miles from the cabin, has a grocery store, sporting goods store and gas station for last minute items.",
