Visitors can expect many days of warm, sunny weather in the summer, and winters with clear skies and plenty of snow.<br /><br />More than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and grasses.<br /><br />The surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support an abundance of wildlife, including deer, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Tumwater Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, ski and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year.<br /><br /> The confluence of Chiwaukum Creek and the Nenatchee River offers anglers a scenic backdrop as they cast their lines into the pools along the shore.
