Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest along the banks of Baker Lake on the west side of the Cascades. This area is one of the most spectacular in the the country, showcasing glacier-covered peaks, broad mountain meadows and old-growth forests. Recreational opportunities abound.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers rugged peaks, scenic rivers and interesting wildlife within the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.<br /><br />On a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Bakers summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br /><br />Visitors will find unique ecosystems surrounding the campground. In the springtime, the towering old-growth forest shelters wildflowers such as western trillium, twinflower, foamflower, coralroot and twistedstalk.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The area is a prime location for hiking, boating, fishing, picnicking and horseback riding in summer and early fall. Visitors can also take advantage of skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.<br /><br />Baker Lake is a popular destination for boating, water skiing, canoeing, fishing and swimming.

Baker caused a forest fire, and visitors can still see the burned snags of virgin cedar trees that once dominated the area. The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Bayview North Group Campground offers one group site made up on several smaller, individual sites.
