    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Perched atop its namesake mountain at an elevation of 5,587 feet, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was built in 1935 for detecting wildfires. During fire season, lookouts stayed in the cabin, watching for lightning strikes and forest fires in the Skykomish drainage. Once the lookout located a fire or smoke, he or she would radio to the Skykomish Ranger Station and give local landmarks to help firefighters locate the fire quickly.<br /><br /> During World War II, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was used as an Aircraft Warning Station, and then remained an active fire tower until the early 1980s. During volunteer restoration efforts in the 1990s, the lookout was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br />The lookout tower must be accessed via a steep, scenic hike on the <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mbs/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=17884&amp;actid=50>Evergreen Lookout Trail</a>.Some amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in many of their own supplies. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>On a clear day, guests at Evergreen Mountain Lookout see views of Glacier Peak, Mt. Daniels, Keyes Peak, Columbia Glacier, Mt. Rainier and parts of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness.  Remains of the last big fire spotted on Evergreen Mountain in 1967 are still evident on the rocky south face of the ridge to within several hundred feet of the lookout.<br /><br />Evergreen Mountain Lookout is situated within the Wild Sky Wilderness area. Wildlife is abundant, and guests may catch a glimpse of black bears, bobcat,elk or bald eagle. Wolves are making a comeback to the area, but they are usually heard and not seen. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, birding and wildlife viewing are popular activities around the lookout.<br /><br />Guests access the lookout via the Evergreen Lookout Trail that climbs steeply through the old Evergreen Mountain Burn of 1967. Hikers enter dense forest, where the grade eases a bit upon reaching a small saddle below the lookout. At this point, the trail ascends again to reach the building. The trail is noted for wildflowers, scenery and wildlife. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 14x14-ft. lookout cabin sleeps four and is furnished with one twin-sized bed and mattress, three extra mattresses, a table and chairs, propane stove, two propane lanterns, two cooking pots, dishes and a coffee pot. A primitive vault toilet is located several hundred feet down the ridge from the lookout.<br /><br />There is no water or heat at the site.  Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing.<br /><br />  Guests must also bring flashlights, sleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and foodmust be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.",
