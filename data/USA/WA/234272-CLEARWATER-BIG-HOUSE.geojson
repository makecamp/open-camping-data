    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Clearwater Big House gives the feel of a winter chalet hideaway, even during the warmest months of the summer. Hiking, horseback riding and scenic drives abound, delighting guests year after year. The Clearwater Lookout Tower is a mile away. The tower is not open, but the area is nice for scenic views. <br /><br />An old trapper cabin was located at the current site and was later used as a ranger station. From 1928-29, a ranger built a three-room house and by 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps was tasked with building a barn, warehouse, outhouse and garage. <br /><br />In winter, the cabin is well-suited for snowmobiling and cross country skiing on groomed snowmobile trails. These modes of over-snow transportation are required for winter access to the cabin.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Set on a gently rolling slope at an elevation of 5,600 feet, the cabin is nestled in a clearing dotted with young Christmas trees. The Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness is nearby, stretching across the northern Blue Mountains of southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. <br /><br />The mountain slopes are carpeted with bunchgrass, lodgepole pine and subalpine fir. An array of wildlife, including Rocky Mountain Elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed and mule deer, black bears, cougars and coyotes, may be spotted. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin provides nearby access to hiking and horseback riding trails that lead to Teal Springs and the lush Tucannon River Drainage. The scenic drive along the Tucannon River to Sunset Point is also a recommended activity.<br /><br />In winter, snowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing trails are right out your front door. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin has 868 square feet of living space on the first floor, and another 336 square feet upstairs, and can accommodate up to 10 people. It is fully furnished with queen, full and twin beds, and a dining table and chairs. Propane heat and lighting are included, and the kitchen is equipped with a propane cook stove and refrigerator. Most cleaning supplies are provided. The cabin does not have indoor bathroom facilities. An outhouse is located across the road. <br /><br />No water is provided. Guests need to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking, and washing. They should also bring cooking pots and utensils, bedding or sleeping bags, dish soap, matches, a flashlight and all other basic camping items. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-clearwater-big-house-cabin.shtml>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest general stores and gas stations are in Pomeroy, a 40-minute drive from the cabin.",

    "FacilityDirections": "From Pomeroy, travel 15th Street south (which becomes Peola Road at the city limits) for 8 miles to the junction of Peola Road/Mountain Road, then south on Mountain Road for 7.5 miles to the forest boundary. The paved road ends here. Continue on Forest Service Road 40 for 7 miles to Clearwater Junction (where the fire lookout is located). Turn left onto FSR 42 for 0.25 mile, and then turn right into the Clearwater Guard Station area. The rental cabin is the two-story building. Automobile access to the site runs from June 1 to November 1, depending on weather conditions. <br /><br />In winter, access is by snowmobile, snowshoes or cross country skis only. Parking is at Rose Spring Sno-Park, and a Sno-Park permit is needed prior to arrival. From there, visitors can follow FSR 40 for just over 5 miles and turn left onto FSR 42. Most of the 5.5-mile trail is groomed, save for the .25 mile stretch on FSR 42.",
