It is a great location to relax and enjoy being away from it all. The site can best be described as resembling a city park with a view. Even though it is near numerous subdivisions, Shell Knob is an unincorporated community.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The pavilion was once the site of Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which operated from 1936 to 1942. Several historic features are still visible within the site. The surrounding area is heavily wooded and provides scenic forest views.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A tennis court, sand volleyball court, a double horseshoe pit and a playground are available. A short walking trail leads to a scenic overlook of Table Rock Lake.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The site includes a lighted pavilion with kitchen facilities, numerous picnic tables and two parking areas. Accessible vault toilets are provided. Drinking water is available only during warm weather months. Only the pavilion can be rented, not the entire site.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Table Rock Lake, which offers all kinds of recreational opportunities, is adjacent to the Shell Knob Recreation Site.",
