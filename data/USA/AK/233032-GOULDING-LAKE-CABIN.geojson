    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Goulding Lake Cabin is located on the northwest shore of Otter Lake on the western edge of Chichagof Island, 60 miles northwest of Sitka, Alaska. The cabin, an A-frame with a sleeping loft, is available from late May through October and makes an excellent base to explore nearby lakes and high alpine meadows.<br /><br />This is a remote cabin that can be accessed only by floatplane, weather permitting. The flight is 50 minutes from Sitka or Juneau. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The area offers wilderness solitude and beauty. Goulding Lake Cabin is located in a flat, lightly wooded area on the northwest shore of Otter Lake, on the western edge of Chichagof Island within the West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness Area.<br /><br />The surrounding terrain varies from open muskegs to densely forested steep slopes. A topographic map of the area is a must for exploration of nearby lakes and high alpine meadows. Brown bear frequent the area. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Visitors enjoy exploring Otter Lake and Goulding Lake to the east. The two lakes are connected. Using the provided skiff, it takes patience to maneuver between the two lakes. Fishing is possible but slow in the area. Cutthroat trout can be caught below the falls and in the lower lake west of the cabin all year. However the provided skiff cannot access the lakes to the west of the cabin. Dolly Varden fishing is year round, while steelhead and coho are seasonal. Photography opportunities abound.<br /><br />For information about fishing permits and seasons, visit the <a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame cabin</a> measures 16 by 16-ft. and accommodates six people. Its sleeping loft (with no bunks) is reached by climbing a vertical ladder. One double-size plywood bunkbed is located on the lower level. A table with benches, a cooking counter, cupboard, wood stove for heat, axe or splitting maul, a broom, an outdoor screened cooler box and an outhouse toilet are provided.<br /><br />The cabin does not include mattresses or cooking gear. Visitors should bring sleeping bags and pads, a cooking stove, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, a lantern, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher, fire starter, rain gear, rubber boots and personal flotation devices (PFDs).<br /><br />Water is available from a nearby stream and from the lake but must be treated before using. Its recommended that visitors bring their own water.<br /><br />A small but heavy skiff with oars is provided. A 2-10 HP long-shaft outboard motor enhances use of the skiff but is not provided. Each person in the skiff should wear a Coast Guard approved PFD. Tie the skiff well up on the shore and pull the plug before leaving so the boat does not fill with rain water.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79078&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin information and maps.",
