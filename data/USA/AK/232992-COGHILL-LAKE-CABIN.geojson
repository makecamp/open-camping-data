    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Coghill Lake Cabin offers opportunities for year-round rest and recreation on College Fiord in Prince William Sound. The cabin is nestled on a lagoon on the southwest shore of beautiful Coghill Lake, which is known for its excellent salmon fishing.<br /><br /> This remote site can be accessed by float plane, which is typically a 50-minute flight from Anchorage or an hour from Cordova. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Coghill Lake Cabin is surrounded by rolling hills on the edge of a stand of conifer trees next to a shallow lagoon, which is connected to the lake by a passage. The cabin offers a view of most of the lagoon, with the Chugach Mountains and glaciers in the background.<br /><br />A large variety of wildlife lives in the area, including Sitka black-tailed deer, bald eagles, waterfowl and river otter. The Coghill Lake area is particularly known for its black bear population, so visitors are urged to practice bear safety. (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>learn about bear safety</a>). <h4>Recreation:</h4>Salmon fishing is excellent from the lakeshore and the lagoon. Anglers can fish for sockeye from mid-June through July, pink and chum in July and August, and coho salmon in August and September. Dolly Varden trout fishing is also good from May through October. The Coghill River, which connects the lagoon to College Fiord, is also a popular spot for sockeye fishing.<br /><br /> For access to other fishing areas on the lake, bring an inflatable boat and life jackets. Hunting for bear and waterfowl is available during designated seasons.<br /><br /> Berry pickers will find plentiful salmonberries and blueberries near the cabin in season. Hikers have access to a challenging 3-mile trail to Port Wells, but the brushis often thick.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 16x16-foot, A-frame with a main floor and a sleeping loft. It accommodates up to 6 guests and comes equipped with wooden bunks, a kerosene heating stove, a table, benches and an outhouse with a pit toilet.<br /><br /> No water, electricity or fuel for the heater is provided.
