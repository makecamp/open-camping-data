    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Harrison Lagoon Cabin is open for year-round enjoyment, offering a variety of recreational opportunities on land and in water. The cabins remote location makes an ideal base for exploring the natural beauty of Prince William Sound.<br /><br /> The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Harrison Lagoon is located on the west side of Port Wells in Prince William Sound. The cabin is tucked into a stand of conifer trees on a gravel spit that separates the lagoon and the Sound. One side faces Port Wells, and the other faces the lagoon. The lagoon itself is surrounded by rocky shoreline and dense evergreen forest, with views of distant snow-capped mountains.<br /><br />Black bears, Sitka black-tailed deer and bald eagles make their home here (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>learn about bearsafety</a>). The lagoon and Port Wells support many seabirds. Dalls and harbor porpoises, harbor seals, sea otter and some sea lions frequent the area. Orcas are sometimes seen in Port Wells. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Guests who have kayaks can use them for exploring the coast or crossing the lagoon, which offers more hiking possibilities than the area around the cabin. It is possible to walk the lagoon at low tide, but tide tables <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9454798>should be consulted</a> to time the return hike at low tide as well.<br /><br />Hunting for bear and waterfowl is allowed with the proper permits in designated areas in-season. Fishing is fair for pink salmon in August, either in Lagoon Creek (inland from Harrison Lagoon) or in saltwater. Shrimping is also possible.<br /><br />Berry pickers can harvest blueberries and salmonberries near the cabin when they are in season. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16 x 20 foot cabin sleeps 6 and is equipped with wooden bunks, a table with benches, a propane stove for heat and an outhouse with pit toilet. Propane may be available onsite during the summer season only (June-August). <br /><br />The cabin does meet accessibility standards, with a boardwalk leading to the outhouse, more floor space and wider doors to accommodate wheelchairs.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Drinking water is accessible by kayak at Lagoon Creek or by walking south of the cabin along the shoreline at low tide, although water taken from natural sources must be treated before drinking. <br /><br />Visitors arriving in winter should bring their own supply of propane. The hookup at the cabin is the same as a standard barbecue grill. Items such as a cook stove, cooking gear, flashlights or lanterns, bedding, toilet paper and garbage bags are not provided. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving.",
