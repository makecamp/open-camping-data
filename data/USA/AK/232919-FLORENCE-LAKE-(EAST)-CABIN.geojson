    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Florence Lake (East) Cabin offers guests recreation, relaxation and a unique wilderness lodging experience on the western side of Admiralty Island in the Tongass National Forest. The remote site offers a scenic setting for  fishing, boating, and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is float plane only. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in a thick vegetated understory, within 150 feet of a small lakeside beach that lies beneath a canopy of old-growth forest. However, much of the surrounding area is private land and has been clear cut. Dense spruce and hemlock forests, glacier-fed streams, lakes and muskeg openings define the surrounding landscape, while rocky spires rise along the islands high crest in the distance.<br /><br />Sitka black-tailed deer stay well hidden in the dense forest but bald eagles are easily found in treetops along most beaches. Waterfowl are in abundance on the islands many lakes, and brown bears frequent the area (learn more about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Florence Lake offers fishing for rainbow trout, Dolly Varden and northern pike. A small fishing boat with oars is provided at the cabin, however, guests need to bring their own life jackets and possibly, a small outboard (10-horsepower) motor.<br /><br /> Hikers may enjoy traversing a primitive 1.2-mile trail at the west end of the lake. The trail leads to a saltwater beach. Beachcombers may find Japanese fishing floats, shells, bottles, and other wave-swept treasures from the open ocean.   <h4>Facilities:</h4>The primitive, cedar log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) has bunk beds with no mattresses and a loft, to accommodate up to seven people. It is also equipped with a table, benches, an oil stove for heat and an outside toilet. Other amenities include cooking counters, shelves, cupboard space and a broom.<br /><br />The cabin does not have running water or electricity. Guests must bring their own water, food, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cook stoves, matches, cooking gear/utensils, light source, No.1 stove oil, toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags, among other necessities.<br /><br />  <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78632&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Bear viewing is available during the summer at Pack Creek if you obtain a permit, or in other remote bays with a little extra effort and skill.
