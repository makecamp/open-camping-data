    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Garnet Ledge Cabin was built in 1964 within the Tongass National Forest. It is open year-round for relaxation, sightseeing and recreation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by a shallow draft boat or a float plane, depending on conditions. Boats need a tide of at least 15 feet and float planes require at least 18 feet in order to access the cabin. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on flat land overlooking the Stikine River delta and tidal flats with a backdrop of moderately steep mountains. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock. The special attraction of this site is Garnet Ledge, a garnet bedrock outcropping located near the cabin.<br /><br />Brown and black bears, bald eagles, sea lions, harbor seals, gulls and moose inhabit the area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). Alaskas second largest concentration of bald eagles occurs during the April hooligan (eulachon) run at the mouth of the Stikine River.<h4>Recreation:</h4>An unmaintained trail leads from the cabin to Garnet Ledge, which sits on private property owned by the Presbyterian Church of Wrangell. Contact the Presbyterian Church for information regarding the collecting of garnets at the Garnet Ledge. <br /><br />Anglers can fish for hooligan in the Stikine River in April. Guests can bring their own kayaks and flotation devices to explore the surrounding area, but should check <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>local tide charts</a> first, to navigate through the water. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) can sleep up to seven people. It has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a second-floor loft. The cabin also has a table with benches, a wood stove, a woodshed with firewood, splitting maul, broom and an outhouse. The partially covered front porch has a bear-proof food storage locker available for use.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a stream behind the cabin, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />In addition to bringing a cook stove, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbagebags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79174&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
