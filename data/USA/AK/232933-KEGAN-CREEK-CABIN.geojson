    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kegan Creek Cabin offers visitors a unique lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. The remote site offers a scenic setting for fishing, hiking, beachcombing and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />The site is accessible by boat or float plane at high tide. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Kegan Creek Cabin is located on Kegan Creek near the outlet of Kegan Lake. It is set back in the surrounding Sitka spruce and western hemlock forest, approximately a half-mile from a saltwater cove on Moira Sound.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area is abundant, including eagles, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears. Learn more about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a> in the Tongass National Forest.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The location of the cabin is prime for anglers. Salmon runs draw both anglers and black bear to Kegan Creek. Rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, dolly varden, and salmon are also found in the nearby lakes, streams and ponds. A boat with oars is provided, which uses a long shaft motor, but guests must bring their own. <br /><br />Hikers might also enjoy the easy half-mile trail along Kegan Creek that connects Kegan Cove with the cabin and Kegan Lake. Beachcombing is another popular pastime at the beach on the cove. A tidal flat emerges at low tide, exposing rock and sea-borne treasures.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12 x 12 foot primitive, pre-cut cedar log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) furnished with wooden bunkbeds (without mattresses) that sleep up to six people.
