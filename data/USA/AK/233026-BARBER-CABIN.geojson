The rustic cabin has few amenities, but provides access to the great outdoors and a scenic mountain lake. There is great fishing in Lower Russian Lake, and hiking and biking trails abound. Wildlife viewing is good in the area as well, though visitors should watch out for bears. <br /><br />Visitors must either hike, bike, ski or fly to the site, depending on conditions. The cabin is more than 3 miles from the nearest parking area. The route is longer in the winter. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is close to Cooper Landing off Sterling Highway, in a fairly flat area on the east shore Lower Russian Lake. It is surrounded by a scattered spruce forest, and meadows with shrubs and brush, providing scenic mountain views. <br /><br />A variety of wildlife make its home in the area, including moose, black and brown bears and wolves.
