    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Shipley Bay Cabin offers visitors recreation, relaxation and a unique lodging experience on Kosciusko Island in southeastern Alaska. The remote site offers a scenic setting for fishing, hiking and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />The site can either be accessed by float plane or boat at high tide. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on a low bluff between Shipley Creek and Shipley Bay on Koscicusko Island. The front of the cabin faces out to a large rocky beach, and a grassy tidal flat extends from its back where Shipley Creek meets the ocean.<br /><br /> Wildlife in the area abounds, including a variety of waterfowl, shore birds, bald eagles, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears. Learn more about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a> in the Tongass National Forest. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin is an excellent location for anglers, as the stream and lake support cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, dolly varden, steelhead and three species of salmon.<br /><br /> Hikers may want to head out from the cabin on a rugged 0.8 mile natural-tread trail connecting Shipley Creek to Shipley Lake. Continuing to Devilfish Bay is an option as well, however good maps and orienteering skills are essential as there is no designated trail.<br /><br />The snow-capped Mount Francis rises 2,592 feet in elevation and can be seen in the distance from the cabin on a clear day.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12 x 14 foot primitive, pre-cut cedar log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) furnished with wooden bunkbeds (without mattresses) that sleep 4-6 guests. <br /><br />The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, an oil stove for heat and an outdoor toilet. Other amenities include a cooking counter, fire extinguisher and a broom.<br /><br />The cabin does not have running water or electricity.
