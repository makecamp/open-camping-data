It is available for reservation year-round and provides access to a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, fishing, hunting and viewing wildlife. The cabin also provides spectacular scenic views of the surrounding area.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed only by float plane or helicopter. The adjacent lake is normally frozen from November through early June, further limiting access.

The region is also home to a variety of wildlife. <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>Click here</a> to learn more about bear safety.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Favorable rock, ice and glacier climbing conditions are found throughout the area.
