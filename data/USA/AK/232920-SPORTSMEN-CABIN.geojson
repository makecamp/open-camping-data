The remote site offers a scenic setting for hiking, fishing, canoeing and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />This is one of two cabins on Distin Lake. It is located on the north side of the lake and within the Admiralty Island Canoe Route.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is float plane or canoe with portage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated under a dense towering canopy of old-growth trees at an elevation of 312 feet, just steps away from scenic Distin Lake.<br /><br /> The Kootznoowoo Wilderness encompasses nearly a million acres of Admiralty Island. Dense spruce and hemlock forests, lakes and muskeg openings define the landscape, while distant rocky peaks tower along the islands high crest, reaching elevations of more than 3,000 feet.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds, including Sitka black-tailed deer, bald eagles, waterfowl and brown bear.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Anglers enjoy Distin Lake for catching cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden and kokanee salmon.<br /><br /> Visitors are welcome to use the skiff with oars available at the cabin and may choose to bring a small outboard motor. The motor must be less than 10 horsepower due to wilderness regulations, and visitors are responsible for bringing and using their own personal floatation devices.

Several trails are accessible by boat along the route, offering guests access to pristine wilderness settings.<br /><br />Trails accessible from Distin Lake go to Thayer Lake (3 miles from Distin Lake cabin), Lake Guerin (.4 mile from the trailhead), and Davidson Lake (.2 mile from the trailhead). Some of the original Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) trail construction is visible along the trail. A small boat at the nearby Guerin Lake shelter provides an opportunity to explore another lake.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Sportsmen Cabin is a small, log cabin in <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>hunter-style</a>, furnished with four bunkbed(s) without mattresses, and can sleep up to six guests.
