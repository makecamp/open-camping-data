    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Allan Point Cabin is located on Halleck Island in upper Nakwasina Sound, about 16 miles north of Sitka, Alaska in the Tongass National Forest. The two-story cabin was built in 1993 by volunteers. It has a large front deck that overlooks Nakwasina Sound and is an excellent base for saltwater fishing and deer hunting.<br /><br />The site can be accessed only by float plane or boat, weather permitting. Travel time from Sitka is 10 minutes by float plane or 30 minutes by boat. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is set at the edge of a tall, dense hemlock-spruce forest on Nakwasina Sound. The cabin faces south, overlooking Nakwasina Sound. <br /><br />In the early 1960s, several forested areas in Nakwasina Sound were harvested. During the summer, the vegetation pattern in these areas appears more dense and a brighter green, with an overstory of alder and an understory of spruce and hemlock.<br />Brown bear frequent the area.
