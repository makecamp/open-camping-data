    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Anan Bay Cabin was originally built in 1964 but a new cabin was constructed in the spring of 2012 using Alaska Yellow Cedar from the Tongass National Forest. The cabin is typically open from May through December, offering relaxation and recreation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage. The cabin is popular with bear watchers and is ideally located near a wildlife observatory, where bears and bald eagles come to fish for salmon in the adjacent creek.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on a gentle slope leading down to the beach, overlooking Anan Bay. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock with some scattered cedar. The slopes around the cabin are gentle to moderate. The nearby lagoon is an intertidal area that often goes dry during low tide.<br /><br />The area provides excellent opportunities to view black and brown bears, harbor seals, bald eagles and various gulls (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>). The high number of salmon in nearby Anan Creek allows visitors the opportunity to view their seasonal spawning in the months of July and August. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The 1-mile Anan Creek Trail leads from the cabin to the Anan Wildlife Observatory. During peak viewing season, the months of July and August, Forest Service interpreters are on-site to provide current information on bear safety, trail conditions and bear activity. There is a high possibility of encountering bears on this trail during this time.<br /><br /> Fishing is only permitted from the shore at the trailhead between June 15th and September 15th, due to bear activity. Steelhead is available in April and May, and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden and pink salmon in July and August. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This 15x17-ft two-story cabin sleeps seven people with two single bunks (one with trundle) and a second floor loft. The cabin also has a table with benches, oil stove (#1 oil only), broom, mooring float and outhouse toilet.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water may be available from a seasonal creek behind the cabin, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cooking with it. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own supply of water.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing a supply of #1 stove oil, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79098&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin details.",
