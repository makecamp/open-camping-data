    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Sitkoh Lake East Cabin is nestled at the eastern end of Sitkoh Lake on southeastern Chichagof Island, 35 miles northeast of Sitka, Alaska. Sitkoh Lake offers two public recreation cabins. This cabin is near the east end of the lake; Sitkoh Lake West Cabin is 2 miles away near the western end of the lake.<br /><br />This is a remote site. The cabin is accessible when the lake is ice-free, generally April through October, and can be accessed from Sitka via a 30-minute flight, weather permitting. The cabin can also be reached by boat and trail. From False Island in Peril Strait, either hike or OHV-ride for 6 miles following Road 7540FI   and Trail 317544 as shown on the Sitka Motor Vehicle Use Map. About 1.5 miles past the trail leading to the Sitkoh Lake West Cabin, follow a 1/2-mile foot trail to the cabin, leaving any OHVs parked at the road near the beginning of the foot trail.<br /><br />Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin lies at the edge of an old-growth forest of spruce and hemlock, with muskeg and open meadows to the east. Seasonal salmonberries and blueberries are in the area. The lakes outlet channel, Sitkoh Creek, is nearby.<br /><br />Sitkoh Lake is surrounded by forested mountains rising to near 2,500 feet. The lake sits at an elevation of 194 feet and is 2.5 miles long and a half-mile wide. Brown bear frequent the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Sitkoh Lake offers fishing, hiking, hunting and off-highway vehicle riding. The lake supports cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden. Sitkoh Creek has runs of steelhead in the spring, pink and sockeye salmon from July to August and coho salmon from August through September. Past logging has left a system of isolated roads.   Hiking and OHV riding are possible.<br /><br />Although it is in poor condition, hikers can explore a 4.3-mile trail along Sitkoh Creek to Sitkoh Bay. <br /><br />Deer hunting is a popular activity in the surrounding area. Waterfowl hunting is possible at Sitkoh Bay. For information about hunting and fishing permits and seasons, visit the <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12 by 14-ft wood <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>Pan abode-style</a> cabin can accommodate up to six people with two double bunks and two single bunks. Amenities include a wood stove for heat, a table with benches, cooking counter, cupboard, broom, axe or splitting maul and an outdoor screened cooler box. An outhouse toilet is located close to the cabin.<br /><br />The cabin does not include mattresses or cooking utensils. Visitors should bring sleeping bags and pads, a cooking stove, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, a lantern, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher, fire starter, rain gear, boots and personal flotation devices (PDFs). <br /><br />Water is available from the creek but must be treated before using. Its recommended that visitors bring their own water.<br /><br />A small but heavy square-bowed skiff (rowboat) with oars is provided. A long-shaft 2-10 horsepower outboard motor enhances use of the skiff but is not provided. Each person in the skiff should wear a Coast Guard approved PFD. Tie the skiff well up on the shore and pull the plug before leaving so the boat does not fill with rain water.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79072&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin information and maps.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>An abandoned logging camp site lies about 6 miles west of the cabin at False Island, with an isolated road system available for exploring surrounding area.",
