    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Crescent Saddle Cabin offers an extremely remote and secluded place to stay in the Kenai Mountains of southeastern Alaska. It is difficult to access, but rewards visitors with spectacular views of the surrounding region. Visitors need to be aware that the cabin sits in an area very prone to avalanches and winter travel is recommended only for those with experience in the backcountry.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by floatplane, or by hiking, skiing or snowmobiling up to 11 miles. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located south of Sterling Highway on the Crescent Lake Trail. It overlooks Crescent Lake, at an elevation of about 1,450 feet. The cabin is set back from the lake, amid a scattered forest and lots of wildflowers in the warmer months.<br /><br />In addition to avalanche danger, high winds may sweep across the lake, causing danger for small boats and planes. For more information on access and regulations pertaining to this cabin, trail conditions, safety precautions and <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r10/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety and ethics</a>, please contact the Seward District office.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing on Crescent Lake is very popular for trophy-size grayling. A rowboat with oars is available at the cabin, but life jackets and fishing equipment are not provided.<br /><br />In season, visitors hunt for moose, black and brown bears and Dall sheep.<br /><br />Hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing and snowshoeing are also popular activities. There is extreme avalanche danger on the Crescent Creek Trail in winter and early spring. The primitive trail around Crescent Lake crosses several avalanche chutes and should not be used in the winter.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14 rustic cabin can sleep four people comfortably, but can accommodate up to eight. It is equipped with wooden bunks, a table, benches and a wood stove for heat. A splitting maul and crosscut saw are available. An outhouse is provided outside the cabin.<br /><br />There is no electricity, potable water, mattresses, bedding, cooking utensils or cut firewood at the cabin. Visitors should bring sleeping bags and pads, a cook stove, cooking gear, water, food and firewood. Water taken from the creek should be treated or boiled before use.",
