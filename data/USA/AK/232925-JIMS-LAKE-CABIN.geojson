    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Jims Lake Cabin offers visitors recreation, relaxation and a remote wilderness lodging experience  in the Tongass National Forest. The rustic cabin is located on the northwest end of Jims Lake, an isolated area in the south-central portion of Admiralty Island. The small lake is away from many flight paths.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is by floatplane only. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on a small rocky rise overlooking Jims Lake, at an elevation of 232 feet. It is hemmed in by dense old-growth forest with views to distant glacier-capped peaks<br /><br /> The cabin is located in the Kootznoowoo Wilderness which encompasses 956,255 acres of Admiralty Island. Dense spruce and hemlock forests, lakes and muskeg define the landscape, while distant rocky peaks tower along the islands high crest, reaching elevations of over 3,000 feet.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds. Sitka black-tailed deer navigate dense forests and bald eagles perch in treetops along most beaches. Brown bear frequent the area as well. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, fishing and wildlife viewing are all within the vicinity of the cabin. Anglers will find Jims Lake to be a scenic setting for catching cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden and kokanee salmon.<br /><br /> Visitors are welcome to use the skiff with oars available at the cabin, and may choose to bring a small outboard motor. The motor must be less than 10 horsepower due to wilderness regulations.
