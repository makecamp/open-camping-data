Visitors can also enjoy views of steep granite walls and snow-capped peaks. The cabin is surrounded by large old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar.<br /><br />The Misty Fiords Monument Wilderness supports a diverse variety of wildlife. Mountain goats, bears, deer, moose and bald eagles make their home here (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a>). Many species of birds may be seen in or around the lake, and visitors may catch a glimpse of beavers in the area. <h4>Recreation:</h4>A 14-foot aluminum skiff with oars is provided for rowing around the lake, but visitors must provide their own life jackets.
