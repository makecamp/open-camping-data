    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Gut Island 1 Cabin was built in 1982 and is the newest of two cabins on-site, which are a few hundred feet apart and connected by a trail. They are available year-round for recreation and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage and provide an excellent base camp for further exploration of the surrounding area.. <br /><br /> The site can be accessed by a shallow draft boat or a float plane, depending on conditions. Boats need a tide of at least 15 feet and float planes require at least 17feet in order to access the cabin. A short walk is required from the anchorage point to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabins are located in the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness, tucked into spruce and hemlock trees on a low rock outcropping between the Stikine River tide flats and the forest. The surrounding terrain is relatively flat with grass and shrubs growing on the tide flats. Wildflowers are prominent in May and June.<br /><br /> Brown and black bear, moose, waterfowl, shorebirds, eagles, hawks and owls can be seen in this area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). The Stikine River tide flats are a major stopover spot during spring and fall bird migrations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The waters around the cabin are ideal for exploring by kayak or canoe during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion in the area, as certain water levels are required to reach the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 14-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>hunter-style</a>) can sleep up to six people. It has two single bunks, two double bunks, a table and benches, broom, an oil stove for heat (No. 1 oil only) and an outhouse toilet. A half-loft provides additional storage space. <br /><br />A small deck wraps around two sides of the cabin, and a wooden cooler box for food storage is located outside.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a catchment, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing a supply of No. 1 stove oil, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79175&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
