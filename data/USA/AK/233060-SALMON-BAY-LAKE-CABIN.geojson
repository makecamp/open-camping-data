    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Salmon Bay Lake Cabin offers visitors a unique Alaskan lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island. Located on the northern part of the island, the remote site offers a scenic setting for recreation and relaxation in the Tongass National Forest.<br /><br />Access to the site is by float plane or a boating/hiking combination, only at high tide. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits back on the rolling, forested shore of Salmon Bay Lake, beneath a towering canopy of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar trees. A large sandy beach extends from the front of the cabin.<br /><br /> Wildlife in the area abounds, including a a variety of waterfowl, eagles, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>Learn more about bear safety in the Tongass National Forest</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>Salmon Bay Lake provides good fishing opportunities for cutthroat, Dolly Varden, pink, chum, coho, and sockeye salmon.<br /><br /> Swimming and beachcombing on the large sandy beach outside the cabin during the warmer summer months is popular, as the cabin receives southern sun exposure.<br /><br />Hikers may be interested in Salmon Bay Lake Trail which extends from the saltwater flats of Salmon Bay to the cabin. This 1.5 mile hike accesses the skiff that is used to access the cabin for those traveling by boat and trail. The trail is rated more difficult because of muddy areas and bad footing on the trail. At the north end of the trail there is some moderate climbing.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12 x 14 foot log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) furnished with wooden bunkbeds (without mattresses) that sleep up to six people. The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, a wood stove for heat and an outdoor toilet. Other amenities include a cooking bench, axe, splitting maul, saw and a broom. <br /><br />The cabin does not have running water or electricity. Visitors must bring their own food, water, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cook stove, stove fuel, fire starter, cooking gear/utensils, light source (lantern), toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags.<br /><br />Firewood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed. Visitors are asked to be conservative with wood and use their cook stoves for cooking. Water is available from the lake, but must be filtered, boiled or chemically treated before drinking.<br /><br /> There is an aluminum skiff with oars available at the cabin, and visitors may choose to bring a long shaft motor for boat use. Visitors are responsible for bringing and using their own personal floatation devices.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78694&amp;actid=101>Click here</a> for more cabin details.",
