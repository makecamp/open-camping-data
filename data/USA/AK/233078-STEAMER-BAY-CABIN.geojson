    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Steamer Bay Cabin was built in 1992 and is on the northwest corner of Etolin Island on the east side of Steamer Bay. It offers a secluded retreat year-round for recreational use and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage.<br /><br /> The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits near a gravel beach and overlooks Steamer Bay and Clarence Strait, as well as large rock outcroppings, a grassy estuary and tidal flats.<br /><br /> The surrounding terrain is mountainous and densely forested with Sitka spruce and western hemlock rainforest. Muskeg is also common in the area.<br /><br /> Brown and black bears, porcupine, deer, waterfowl, porpoises, whales and other marine life are commonly seen in the area (learn about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a>). Roosevelt elk were introduced here and thrive on Etolin Island. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Saltwater fishing for King salmon is possible from May through July, silver salmon in August and September, and halibut from June through September. Dolly Varden and pink salmon (July through August) are available in nearby Porcupine Creek.<br /><br />Steamer Bay offers opportunities for crabbing, as well as digging for clams and abalone. The gravel beach, nearby islands and rocky shorelines invite beachcombing.<br /><br /> The surrounding area can be explored on foot or by water, but <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451005>tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating, kayaking or canoeing excursion.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 20-by-20 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>modified A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a partial loft, to sleep up to seven people.
