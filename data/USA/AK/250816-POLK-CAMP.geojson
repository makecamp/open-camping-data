    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Polk Camp is a three bedroom cabin located in Polk Inlet on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. The site offers recreation, relaxation and a unique lodging experience in the Tongass National Forest.<br /><br />Polk Camp once served as a remote administration camp for the Craig Ranger District and is now a recreation cabin with amenities including a kitchen and running water. The cabin is accessible by vehicle, boat or floatplane.<br /><br />Although the site is not as remote as others in the area, visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<br /><br /><h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is nestled in a canopy of young Sitka spruce and western hemlock. There are plenty of places to explore in the Polk Inlet area, including an estuary just south of the cabin, where wildlife is abundant, including sandhill cranes, eagles, wolves, black bears, Sitka black-tailed deer and a variety of migratory birds.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Anglers will find that Dog Salmon Creek, which flows into the inlet, has an excellent run of coho, chum and pink salmon, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout and Dolly Varden. Crabbing, beachcombing and wildlife viewing are popular in the area as well.<br /><br />Dog Salmon Fish Pass is noted as a popular bear viewing site in August. A system of roads for off-road enthusiasts is also in the vicinity.<br /><br />Hunters can take advantage of the long hunting seasons in the surrounding national forest. Bear season occurs during spring and fall, while deer season begins in late summer and lasts through late fall.<br /><br />Polk Inlet also has a rich logging history. Log landings and log transfer facilities can be found on the nearby shoreline, but are not visible from the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The Polk Camp has a large kitchen with a fully functional propane stove and oven, running water in the sink, and plenty of counter and cupboard space.  There are three bedrooms with two moveable beds in each room.  A bathroom with flush toilet and hot shower is available from May through November. (Water will be shut off in winter.)  There is a large gathering room, a great deck and exquisite views.  Polk Camp is a wonderful spot for a family reunion, a wedding or a weekend with your friends.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Nearby attractions include: Dog Salmon Wildlife Viewing Area; Polk Inlet Road system; Polk Inlet all-terrain vehicle roads (trails); hunting; fishing; crabbing; wildlife viewing.",
