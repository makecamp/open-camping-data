    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Berg Bay Cabin is a rustic cabin built in 1965. It is available year-round and offers opportunities for a variety of recreational activities, including fishing, crabbingand hiking. Its secluded location within Alaskas Inside Passage makes it an ideal retreat for those in search of a back country experience.<br /><br />  The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on a gentle slope overlooking Berg Bay, Blake Channel and the mountains beyond. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock with scattered cedar and muskeg. The nearby Aaron Creek tide flats have extensive grass sedges and wildflowers.<br /><br /> This area is habitat for brown and black bears, moose, sea otters, grouse, ptarmigan and waterfowl (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). Mountain goats can sometimes be spotted on the surrounding ridges.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers have access to two trails. The 4-mile Aaron Creek Trail extends from Berg Bay to Berg Creek. Berg Creek Trail is an unmaintained 4-mile trail that leads from the mouth of Berg Creek to Berg Basin.<br /><br />Aaron and Oerns Creeks offer opportunities to fish for pink salmon from mid-July to mid-August, silver and chum salmon from August to September and steelhead in April and May. Crabbing is possible in Berg Bay and in saltwater in front of Aaron Creek tidal flats.<br /><br />Guests can bring canoes or kayaks to explore around Berg Bay. The entrance to Berg Bay is shallow and may dry out at low tide, so <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451152>local tide charts</a> should be consulted before taking any boating excursion in the area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a second-floor loft, to accommodate up to seven people. The cabin also has a table with benches, oil stove (No.1 oil required), a fire grill, broom, mooring float and outhouse toilet. The partially covered front porch has a wooden cooler box for food storage.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a small stream next to the cabin, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing a supply of #1 stove oil, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79156&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
