Situated on the northern part of the island, the remote site provides a scenic setting for recreation and relaxation in the Tongass National Forest.<br /><br />Access to the site is by float plane or a vehicle/hiking/boating combination. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on the forested shore of Red Bay Lake. The lake is lined with old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar trees, with a dense understory of brush and rocky outcroppings. Visible from the cabin, the vertical wall of Red Bay Mountain rises 3,000 feet in elevation along with neighboring limestone peaks.<br /><br /> Wildlife in the area abounds, including loons, eagles, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears.
