    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Little Dry Island Cabin was built in 1980 and is available for year-round recreational use and relaxation on the Stikine River delta in the Stikine-LaConte Wilderness. The secluded retreat gives guests a true back country experience in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by float plane or shallow draft boat, depending on conditions. Access to the cabin requires at least a 15-foot tide for boats and a 17-foottide for float planes. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is perched on a low rock outcrop between tide flats and a forest of spruce and hemlock. The surrounding terrain is relatively flat with grass and shrubs growing on the tide flats. Wildflowers are prominent in May and June.<br /><br />Brown and black bears, bald eagles, owls, hawks and moose inhabit the area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). The Stikine River tidal flats are a major stopover spot for waterfowl and shorebirds during spring and fall migrations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The waters around the cabin are ideal for exploring by kayak or canoe during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion.<br /><br />Waterfowl hunting is possible in the fall with proper permits. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>modified A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a second-floor loft, to sleep up to seven people. It also has a table with benches, a wood heat stove, a woodshed with firewood, splitting maul, broom and an outhouse. A wooden cooler box for food storage is attached to the cabin.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water may be available from a rain catchment barrel, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />In addition to bringing a cook stove, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbagebags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79184&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
