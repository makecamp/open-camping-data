    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Paulson Bay Cabin offers a secluded getaway for relaxation and recreation in the beautiful Prince William Sound. The cabin is open year-round and makes a great base for sea kayaking, fishing, shrimping and sightseeing.<br /><br />  This remote site can be accessed by a float plane or by boat, depending on conditions. The cabin sits on a bluff and can be reached by some steps leading up from the beach. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Paulson Bay Cabin is situated at the head of Paulson Bay, on the west side of Cochrane Bay in Prince William Sound. The terrain is rolling and grades into rugged mountains. The cabin is set in an open wooded area with muskeg nearby and offers a spectacular view of Port Wells and College Fiord with Harvard Glacier in the background.<br /><br />Black bears, Sitka black-tailed deer and bald eagles make their home here (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>learn about bear safety</a>). Prince William Sound supports abundant sea life, including waterfowl, sea otters, Orcas, Dalls porpoises, harbor seals and sea lions.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking in the area is fairly easy because there is relatively little brush to inhibit movement. A three-quarter mile route leads north from the cabin to the creek.<br /><br /> Guests can bring kayaks for exploring the coastline and the bay. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9454798>Local tide reports</a> should be consulted before any kayaking trip, and kayakers should watch out for the numerous submerged rock ledges in the area.<br /><br />Fishing is good for chum and pink salmon, usually from late July through August. Guests can also catch shrimp and bottom fish. Hunting for bear and waterfowl is available in season with the proper permits. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12 x 14 foot cabin sleeps 6 and comes equipped with wooden bunks, a table with benches, a propane stove for heat, fire extinguisher, broom and an outhouse with pit toilet. Propane may be available onsite during the summer season only (June-August). <br /><br />Water and electricity are not available. Guests must bring their own supply of drinking water, as well as a supply of propane if they are staying during the winter months. The propane hookup at the cabin is the same as a standard gas barbecue grill.<br /><br />Items such as a cook stove, cooking gear, flashlights or lanterns, bedding, sleeping pads, trash bags and toilet paper are not provided. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving.",

    "FacilityDirections": "To access the cabin by float plane, it is 40 minutes from Anchorage and 60 minutes from Cordova.

Beware of submerged rock ledges between islands and off coastal points.<br /><br /> Check <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9454798>local tide tables</a> ahead of time to determine the best arrival and departure times.",
