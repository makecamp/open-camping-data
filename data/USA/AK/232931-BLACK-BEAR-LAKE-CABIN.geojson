    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Black Bear Lake Cabin offers recreation, relaxation and a unique lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. The remote site offers a scenic, mountainous setting for fishing, hiking and wildlife viewing.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is by floatplane only. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated at an elevation of 1,700 feet, 20 yards from the shoreline of Black Bear Lake, a cold, clear lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks reaching elevations of 4,000 feet. The terrain is rugged with a mixture of old-growth forest and alpine vegetation. The high mountains and alpine terrain is quite stunning, showcasing a display of wildflowers in mid-summer.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area is abundant, including Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears. <br /><br /> A hydroelectric project was constructed at the north end of the lake in 1995. The project now provides power to several communities on the island. The lake level varies, but is still a popular destination.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Anglers will find fair fishing on a resident population of rainbow trout. Boating or kayaking on the lake offers a peaceful setting for viewing wildlife in the area.<br /><br />Hunters can take advantage of the long hunting season in the surrounding national forest. Bear season occurs during spring and fall, while deer season begins in late summer and lasts through the late fall.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x12-ft primitive, pre-cut cedar, <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a> log cabin sleeps up to six people on wooden bunkbeds without mattresses. The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, an oil stove for heat and an outside toilet.
