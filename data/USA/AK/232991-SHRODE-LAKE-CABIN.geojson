    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Shrode Lake Cabin is open year-round, offering the opportunity to enjoy both summer and winter recreation in beautiful Prince William Sound. The cabin is in a secluded location that provides a true backcountry experience.<br /><br />  The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Those arriving by boat should be prepared to hike 1 mile to the cabin from where the boat anchors at Long Bay. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Shrode Cabin is situated on the northeastern shore of Shrode Lake, a freshwater lake near Long Bay, which is just off Culross Passage in Prince William Sound. Shrode Lake is separated from the saltwater Long Bay by a lagoon.<br /><br /> The cabin is located in an open grassy and muskeg area with evergreen forest nearby. The front of the cabin overlooks the lake and surrounding mountains.<br /><br />Black bears, Sitka black-tailed deer, waterfowl and bald eagles make their home here (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>learn about bear safety</a>). <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hike on the 1 mile trail to Long Bay or hike to Jack Lake, which is a half-mile from the cabin. Threefingers Cove to the west of Shrode Lake is another beautiful hiking destination. The Jack Lake and Threefingers Cove trails are primitive trails and may require some route finding.<br /><br /> Anglers can fish for sockeye salmon in mid-July, a relatively small run which passes through quickly. Abundant pink salmon are available from mid-July to mid-August, and silver salmon in late August. Fishing takes place in Long Bay (saltwater), the lagoon between saltwater and Shrode Lake, and the stream that drains Shrode Lake. Dolly Varden is available in Shrode Lake.<br /><br /> Guests can use the small rowboat and oars provided by the Forest Service, but should bring their own personal floatation device. It is important to consult tide tables before boating in order to properly navigate the lagoon and avoid the numerous rock hazards in the area (<a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.shtml?gid=276>local tide tables</a>).<br /><br /> In season deer and bear hunting is possible in designated areas with a permit. The terrain and amount of snowfall makes for excellent cross-country and telemark skiing in the winter. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 16 x 16 foot A-frame with a main floor and a sleeping loft. It accommodates up to 6 people and comes equipped with wooden bunks, a kerosene heater, a table, benches, broom, fire extinguisher and an outhouse with a pit toilet.<br /><br /> No water, electricity or fuel for the heater is provided. Freshwater is available around the cabin, but it must be treated before drinking.<br /><br /> Visitors are responsible for bringing their own drinking water, kerosene for heater (1 gallon will last 4-6 hours), a cook stove, flashlights or lanterns, bedding, mattresses, toilet paper, garbage bags, cookware, dishes and utensils.",

    "FacilityTypeDescription": "Camping",
    "FacilityDirections": "Access by float plane is 45 minutes from Anchorage and 55 minutes from Cordova. By boat the trip is 25 miles from Whittier into Long Bay, then an additional 1mile hike on a trail to reach the lake.<br /><br />Boats should anchor in Long Bay. Only shallow-draft vessels can proceed during high tide as far as the lagoon at the head of Long Bay. Numerous rock hazards are in the channel and lagoon.<br /><br />In fall, winter, spring and early summer, the cabin may be inaccessible by float plane due to frozen lake surface. Ice has been observed on Shrode Lake as late as July. Contact the Glacier Ranger District office (907) 783-3242 for information prior to making reservations during these periods.",
