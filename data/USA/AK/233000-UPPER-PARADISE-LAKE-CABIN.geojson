    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Upper Paradise Lake Cabin is extremely remote and secluded in the forest of south-central Alaska. Its location requires visitors to be prepared to handle emergency situations. The cabin provides primitive accommodations and access to fishing and hunting in season, as well as day hikes that warrant spectacular views of glaciers.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible only by floatplane and access is extremely difficult in the winter when the lake freezes. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located east of Seward Highway, on the eastern shore of Upper Paradise Lake. It sits in a forest of alder and willow trees at an elevation of about 1,340 feet. A trail to the cabin is not maintained, but offers very scenic views. Wild berries are ripe for the picking in late-summer to fall.<br /><br />For more information on access and regulations pertaining to this cabin, trail conditions, safety precautions and <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r10/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety and ethics</a>, please contact the Seward District office.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin offers seclusion and good fishing. A rowboat and oars provided at the cabin gives anglers excellent opportunities to catch grayling on the small, adjacent lake. Life jackets are not provided, however.<br /><br />Hunting is popular during designated seasons. The area is home to a variety of wildlife, including moose, black and brown bears and mountain goats. <br /><br />While there are no groomed trails in the area, it is rife with potential for exploration. A good day hike leads to views of the majestic Wolverine Glacier, high in the Kenai Mountains. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14-ft rustic cabin has wooden bunks and sleeps four people comfortably, but can accommodate up to eight. It is equipped with a table, benches and a wood stove for heat. An outdoor toilet is provided. Firewood is limited in the area.<br /><br />Visitors will need to bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes. Water taken from the lake must be treated or boiled prior to consumption. Visitors will also need to bring their own bedding and sleeping pads, flashlights, cooking gear, food, clothing and cooking utensils, among other necessities. All garbage and food must be packed out.",
