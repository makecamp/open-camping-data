    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Gut Island 2 Cabin was built in 1967 and is the oldest of two cabins on-site, which are a few hundred feet apart and connected with a trail. It is available year-round recreational use and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage. The cabin provides an excellent base camp for further exploration of the area.<br /><br /> The site can be accessed by a shallow draft boat or a float plane, depending on conditions. Boats need a tide of at least 15 feet and float planes require at least 17feet in order to access the cabin. A short walk is required from the anchorage point to get to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Gut Island Cabins are located in the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness, tucked into spruce and hemlock trees on a low rock outcrop between the Stikine River tide flats and the forest. The surrounding terrain is relatively flat with grass and shrubs growing on the tide flats. Wildflowers are prominent in May and June.<br /><br /> Brown and black bear, moose, waterfowl, shorebirds, eagles, hawks and owls can be seen in this area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). The Stikine River tide flats are a major stopover spot during spring and fall bird migrations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The waters around the cabin are ideal for exploring by kayak or canoe during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 12-by-14 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>hunter-style</a>) has two single bunks and two double bunks to sleep up to four people. It is also equipped with a table and benches, broom, oil stove for heat (No. 1 oil only) and an outhouse toilet. A wooden cooler box for food storage is attached to the cabin.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a catchment, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing a supply of No. 1 stove oil, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities.
