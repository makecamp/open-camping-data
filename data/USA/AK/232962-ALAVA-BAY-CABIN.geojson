    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Alava Bay Cabin was built in 1974 and sits on Revillagigedo Island on the southwest side of Alava Bay. This secluded retreat is open year-round and offers opportunities for relaxation, sightseeing and a variety of recreational activities within the Misty Fiords National Monument Wilderness.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by floatplane, boat or kayak, depending on conditions. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is backed by old-growth rainforest with a rocky beach nearby. The surrounding landscape features gentle slopes and dense forest. Visitors can look out over Alava Bay from the front deck of the cabin. A small island is nearby, situated between the bay and Behm Canal.<br /><br />This is often a stop for those exploring Misty Fiords, an area known for its unusual rock formations, steep fjord walls and quiet inlets.<br /><br /> Black and brown bears, wolves, moose, bald eagles and Sitka black-tailed deer are common to this area. Misty Fiords is home to a variety of marine mammals, including orcas, humpback whales, harbor seals and sea lions. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The bay and surrounding area can be explored by kayak, but visitors must bring their own equipment. Navigating the waters here poses a challenge due to tides, merging currents and exposure to open ocean waters (<a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9450382>local tide charts</a>).<br /><br />Opportunities exist for saltwater fishing, hiking and beachcombing. Hunting for Sitka black-tailed deer and black bear is a popular pastime.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 12x14-ft. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a> cabin sleeps six and comes equipped with two single bunks, two double bunks, a table and benches, broom, wood heater and an outhouse.<br /><br /> The cabin has a front deck and receives plenty of sunshine on clear mornings.
