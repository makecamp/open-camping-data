    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kennel Creek Cabin is located near Kennel Creek along the south shore of Freshwater Bay, on the northeast side of Chichagof Island.  It offers visitors excellent opportunities for recreation and viewing scenery and wildlife.  <br /><br />This is a primitive cabin with no electricity, indoor plumbing or cell phone coverage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring their own amenities.  <br /><br />The cabin is generally available year-round, depending on weather, and makes an excellent base for experiencing this corner of Alaska.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin rests on the shoreline of Freshwater Bay.  Views from the cabin&rsquo;s balcony and deck overlook the bay and surrounding snow peaked mountains. The cabin is backed by dense evergreen forest.  Kennel Creek flows into the bay about 200 yards away.  This area offers abundant wildlife, including whales, brown bear, deer, shorebirds and a variety of small mammals (learn about bear safety and precautions).<h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin has good access to hunting and both freshwater and saltwater fishing areas. For information about hunting and fishing permits and seasons, visit the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website.  <br /><br />A gravel beach in front of the cabin is suitable for landing and launching small boats. Tide tables should be consulted prior to any boating excursion (local tide charts).  There is also a boat ramp and dock facility nearby.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16 X 22-ft. milled cedar log cabin has a sleeping loft, balcony and deck. The cabin accommodates up to 8 people.  There is one single over double bunk on the main floor and a full sleeping loft.  Inside, the cabin features a food preparation counter, a sturdy wood table with 4 benches and a wood stove for heat.  Outside there is a large picnic table, fire ring, vault toilet and firewood shelter. The first level of the cabin, the main deck, and vault toilet and picnic table are all accessible facilities for visitors with disabilities. <br /><br />Firewood is not provided; however, a small woodshed nearby allows visitors to store and keep firewood dry for use at the cabin.  Other suggested items to bring are: water for drinking, cooking and cleaning; mattresses; cooking gear; sleeping bags; lanterns or flashlights; food; toilet paper; garbage bags; and fire starter. Rain gear and boots are also recommended. No dumpsters are available, so visitors are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78716&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin details and maps.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Bear Paw Lake Trail system is located approximately 4 miles from the cabin.",
