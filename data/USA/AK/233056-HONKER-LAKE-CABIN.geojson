    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Honker Lake Cabin offers visitors recreation, relaxation and a unique lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. The remote site offers a scenic setting for fishing, canoeing and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />The site can either be accessed by float plane or canoe. Canoeing is a common way to access the cabin as it is located on the Honker Divide Canoe Route. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on the gently rolling shoreline of Honker Lake. It is surrounded by a temperate rainforest of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar, and an understory of dense huckleberry and salmonberry bushes.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area abounds, including a variety of waterfowl. The site is named after the migrating Canada geese (&quot;honkers&quot;) that frequent the area. Bald eagles, wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears are also in the area. Learn more about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a> in the Tongass National Forest. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/pow/recreation/rogs/honker_canoe_trail.shtml>Honker Divide Canoe Route</a> is Prince of Wales Islands longest trail. It extends 30 miles on the Hatchery Creek/Thorne River system through the heart of the island, affording glimpses of mountain views, expansive muskegs and open river. <br /><br />The Honker Divide Canoe Route is a challenging combination of river and lake paddles. The first 7 miles are against the current and the portages are on natural tread and may be muddy, but the trip is well worth the effort. Boaters should plan ahead and prepare for changing weather conditions and always wear personal floatation devices when boating.<br /><br />Anglers will find that the area is quite scenic while fishing for rainbow and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, coho and sockeye salmon. Hikers can hike extensively on primitive trails along the lakes edge.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12 x 12 foot primitive, pre-cut cedar log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) furnished with wooden bunkbeds (without mattresses) that sleep up to six guests. The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, a wood stove for heat and an outside toilet. Other amenities include a cooking counter, shelves, cupboard space, an axe, splitting maul, and a broom. Firewood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed.<br /><br />The cabin does not have running water or electricity. Guests must bring their own food, water, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cook stove, stove fuel, fire starter, cooking gear/utensils, light source (lantern), toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags. Water is available from the lake, but must be filtered, boiled or chemically treated before drinking.<br /><br />  There is an aluminum skiff with oars available at the cabin, and guests may choose to bring a long shaft motor for boat use. Guests are responsible for bringing and using their own personal floatation devices.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78678&amp;actid=101>Click here</a> for more cabin details.",

    "FacilityDirections": "Honker Lake Cabin is accessible by float plane or canoe along the Honker Divide Canoe Route.<br /><br /> The cabin is 54 air miles from Ketchika. In fall, winter, and early spring, the cabin may be inaccessible as float planes cannot land on the frozen lake surface.<br /><br /> The canoe launch at Hatchery Creek Bridge is 6 miles to the cabin, and typically takes 7-8 hours of paddling. The canoe route is recommended at moderate to high water. There are several portages and some difficult upstream paddling.
