It sits on the Stikine River delta in the scenic Stikine-LeConte Wilderness. The cabin is open year-round for recreational use and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by float plane or shallow draft boat, depending on conditions. Access to the cabin requires at least a 14-foot tide for boats and 16 feet forfloat planes. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on relatively flat land with grass and shrubs growing on the tide flats. It is situated between the tide flats and a forest of spruce and hemlock. Behind the cabin are low-to-moderate forested hills. Wildflowers are prominent in May and June.<br /><br /> LeConte Glacier is within boating distance of the cabin at high tide. There are icebergs in LeConte Bay and in Fredrick Sound, along the Horn Cliffs.<br /><br />Brown and black bears, bald eagles, owls, hawks and moose inhabit the area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). The Stikine River tidal flats are a major stopover spot for shorebirds and waterfowl during spring and fall migrations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The area around the cabin is ideal for exploring by kayak or canoe during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451335>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>modified A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a second-floor loft, to sleep up to seven people.
