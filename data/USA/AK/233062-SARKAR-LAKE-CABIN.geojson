    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Sarkar Lake Cabin offers guests recreation, relaxation and a unique lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. The remote site offers a scenic setting for fishing, canoeing and wildlife viewing, all within the vicinity of the cabin.<br /><br />The site can either be accessed by vehicle and a two mile boat trip, or by float plane. Canoeing is a common way to access the cabin. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on the shore of Sarkar Lake near the start of the Sarkar Lake Canoe Route. The shoreline is surrounded by a temperate rainforest of old-growth forest, towering over muskeg openings, lakes and streams.<br /><br /> Wildlife in the area abounds, including a variety of waterfowl, bald eagles, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears. Learn more about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety</a> in the Tongass National Forest. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/pow/recreation/rogs/sarkar_canoe_rt.shtml>Sarkar Lakes Canoe Route</a> offers boaters the opportunity to explore a relatively pristine area of lakes and islands, where salmon streams enter the lake and bears and deer are frequently spotted. The entire route is 16 miles, with 3 miles of portage. Boaters should plan ahead and prepare for changing weather conditions and always wear personal floatation devices when boating.<br /><br />A developed boat launch and parking area provides easy access to the canoe route, and rental companies will deliver boats and gear upon request. Check with the Chamber of Commerce for details.<br /><br />Anglers will find Sarkar Lake to be a quiet, scenic spot for a variety of trout and salmon fishing. The Sarkar Rapids burst with sockeye salmon each July, attracting black bears and harbor seals. Bird watchers are also drawn to the Sarkar area because of its wide array of waterfowl.<br /><br />  Hunters can take advantage of the long hunting season in the surrounding national forest. Bear season occurs during spring and fall, while deer season begins in late summer and lasts through the late fall.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12 x 12 foot primitive, pre-cut cedar log cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) furnished with wooden bunkbeds (without mattresses) that sleep up to six guests.
