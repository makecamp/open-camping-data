    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Reflection Lake Cabin is situated on the Cleveland Peninsula at the shore of Reflection Lake approximately 50 air miles from Ketchikan. The cabin is available year-round and makes an excellent base for experiencing this corner of Alaska with its recreation options, beautiful scenery and abundant wildlife.<br /><br /> The cabin is remote and accessible only by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Boats can be moored in Short Bay, and visitors can hike 2.3 miles to the cabin along the Reflection Lake Trail.<br /><br /> This primitive cabin has no electricity, indoor plumbing or cell phone coverage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in heavily wooded area backed by hills. The area features numerous rolling muskegs, and the cabin offers stunning views of steep mountains with peaks as high as 5,000 feet and clinging ice fields.  <br /><br />Wildlife includes Sitka black-tailed deer, black and brown bear, mountain goat, wolf, beaver, marten, mink and otter (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety and precautions</a>). A variety of birds may be spotted in or near the lake. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing, boating, hiking and hunting are popular options at this cabin. Steelhead and salmon runs occur in Short Creek. Resident trout and Dolly Varden are available in the lake. For information about fishing and hunting permits and seasons, visit the <a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<br /><br /> A 14-foot aluminum skiff with oars is provided for rowing around the lake, but visitors must provide their own life jackets. The skiff can use a short-shaft motor, which is not provided.<br /><br />The 2.3-mile Reflection Lake Trail spans from Short Bay in northern Behm Canal to Reflection Lake Cabin. The bridge near Short Bay is out, so hikers must be prepared to ford the stream. This is only possible during low water.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14-ft. (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) log cabin accommodates 6 people with 2 single and 2 doublebunks. Other amenities include a table and benches, a cooking counter, food storage, broom, axe and splitting maul. A wood stove is provided for heat, and firewood is stocked in the woodshed. An outhouse is located close to the cabin.<br /><br />Drinking water is not available at the cabin. Visitors must bring their own water supply, but water is also available from a nearby creek(<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety</a>).<br /><br />Visitors should also bring sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking gear, lanterns or flashlights, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter.
