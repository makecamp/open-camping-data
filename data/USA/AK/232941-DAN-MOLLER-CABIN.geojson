    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Dan Moller Cabin was originally built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps as part of a combined effort by the Juneau Ski Club and the Forest Service to develop winter recreation on Douglas Island. It was named after a Forest Service employee who was also the founding member of the Juneau Ski Club. The cabin was rebuilt in 2010 and now features a design that withstands heavy snow loads.<br /><br />The site is open year-round and can be accessed by hiking, snowshoeing or skiing on a 3-mile trail with an 1,800-foot elevation gain. Access by snowmobile is allowed only when snow is at least a foot deep. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at an elevation of 1,800 feet, surrounded by the scenic alpine landscape of central Douglas Island. It is located near the headwaters of Kowee Creek.Views from the front of the cabin reveal snow-capped peaks and evergreen trees.<br /><br />The access trail to the cabin follows Kowee Creek and features meadows that bloom with summer wildflowers. Wildlife in the area includes black bear, grouse, deer and wolves (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Dan Moller trailhead to access the cabin is partially planked and passes through muskeg. Trail planks are slippery when wet or frosty. There is a high avalanche danger in winter and early spring. The trail continues past the cabin and into the mountains.<br /><br />A ski bowl above the cabin offers relatively flat terrain for cross-country and telemark skiing. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This 16-by-20 cedar cabin sleeps eight and comes equipped with a double and single bunk on the first floor and a sleeping loft with two long platforms that canaccommodate two people each. Other amenities include a table with benches, broom and dustpan, propane furnace, wood stove, snow shovel and an outhouse. Propane is provided for the furnace. A covered deck extends from the front of the cabin.<br /><br /> Water, firewood and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a nearby stream uphill from the cabin, but visitors should be sure to treat water before drinking or cooking with it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that visitors bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Cooking facilities are not available. Visitors should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter. Visitors are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78765&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin details and maps.",
