    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Phocena Bay Cabin sits on the south shore of Phocena Bay on the west side of Gravina Island approximately 15 miles from Ketchikan. The cabin was constructed in 1973 and moved to its current site in 1985. The cabin is available year-round and makes an excellent base for experiencing this corner of Alaska with its recreation options,beautiful scenery and abundant wildlife.<br /><br /> The cabin is remote and accessible only by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. This primitive cabin has no electricity, indoor plumbing or cell phone coverage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is tucked into a sheltered cove on fairly flat terrain, and is backed by rainforest. A large tide flat appears in front of the cabin at low tide. The cabin deck offers a spectacular view of Chapin Peak and the Puppet Mountains.<br /><br />Gravina Island supports populations of Sitka black-tailed deer, wolves, marten, mink, beaver and black bear (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>). Bald eagles nest in the area, and there have been sightings of Queen Charlotte goshawks around Phocena Bay. Visitors may have opportunities to see humpback and killer whales in Clarence Strait. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The area lends itself to easy hiking to explore nearby tide pools and the surrounding forest. Exploring can also be done via kayak or boat, but <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9450339>local tide tables</a> first, since there is almost no water in front of the cabin at low tide.<br /><br />Saltwater fishing is possible for ling cod, red snapper, halibut and salmon outside the bay. For information about fishing permits and seasons, visit the <a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14-ft.

Other amenities include a table and benches, a cooking counter, food storage, broom, axe and splitting maul. A wood stove is provided for heat, and firewood is stocked in the woodshed. An outhouse is located close to the cabin.<br /><br />A mooring buoy is located in the bay near the cabin on a first-come, first-served basis. More than one vessel is allowed if the first party there agrees.<br /><br />Drinking water is not available at the cabin. Visitors must bring their own water supply, but water is also available from a roof water collection system(<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety</a>).<br /><br />Visitors should also bring sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking gear, lanterns or flashlights, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter. Rain gear and boots are recommended. Visitors are expected to pack out their trash, gear and food and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=  http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78931&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>additional cabin details</a>).",
