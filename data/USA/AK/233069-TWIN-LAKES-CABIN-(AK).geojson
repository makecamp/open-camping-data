    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Twin Lakes Cabin, built in 1963, sits on the mouth of Twin Lakes Slough on the Stikine River in the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness. It is open year-round for relaxationand recreational use in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by shallow draft boat, float plane or kayak, depending on conditions. Low river levels can affect access to the cabin and Twin Lakes. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on relatively flat land facing Limb Island and the upper end of Hooligan Slough. The surrounding trees are primarily Sitka spruce, cottonwood, alder andwillow. The vegetation in front of the cabin is mostly grass, with meadows nearby.<br /><br /> A sand beach between the riverbank and the slough can be accessed at low river levels. Steep mountains rise from behind Figure 8 Lake, known locally as Twin Lakes, which is about 400 feet behind the cabin.<br /><br /> Brown and black bears are common in the area, and moose may be seen in the willow thickets (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). Mountain goats inhabit the nearby mountains. The Stikine River tide flats are a major stop for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds in the springand fall.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Fishing is possible in Dog Salmon Creek (North Arm Creek) about 1.7 miles west of the cabin. Cutthroat trout is available from May through September. Salmon fishing includes chum, pink in July and August, and silver in August and September.<br /><br />Twin Lakes offers opportunities for swimming, paddling and water skiing. A picnic site is located on the south shore of the lake that includes two campfire rings. When entrance to the lakes becomes restricted at low river levels, a 0.1-mile trail leads from the cabin to the site (<a href=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ak/nwis/uv/?site_no=15024800&amp;meter_cd=00065,00060>Stikine River level at Shakes Gage</a>).<br /><br />It is possible to explore the Stikine River area and the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness by canoe or kayak, but <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.shtml?gid=276 TARGET=>local tide charts</a> and river levels should be consulted in advance. Hunting is available in the area with the proper permits.  <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a second-floor loft, to sleep up to seven people.
