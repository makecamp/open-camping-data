    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Devils Pass Cabin is a rustic cabin in a remote area of south-central Alaska. It provides minimal accommodations, but maximum access to the great outdoors with scenic mountain views and a variety of wildlife in the surrounding area. Visitors enjoy hiking and hunting, among other outdoor recreation opportunities. The cabin has recently been rebuilt to provide a more sturdy structure for the hardy campers who grace it.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by hiking, mountain biking, cross country skiing or snowmobiling about 10 miles each way, crossing a variety of ecosystems from aspen and spruce to tundra and muskeg. Snowmobiles are only allowed on the trails every other year. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located at the intersection of Devils Creek Trail and Resurrection Pass Trail, in the Kenai Mountains of southeastern Alaska. It sits in an alpine valley, closely surrounded by mountains and not far from Devils Pass Lake. The beginning of Juneau Creek is also near the cabin. Due to a high frequency of travelers in the area, the cabin provides limited privacy. <br /><br />A variety of wildlife makes its home in the surrounding forest. Mosquitoes are thick in areas along the trail, especially close to the beaver dams on the ponds. For more information on access and regulations pertaining to this cabin, trail conditions, safety precautions and <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r10/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety and ethics</a>, please contact the Seward District office.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A handful of Forest Service cabins lie along the 72 miles of the Resurrection Pass Trail, and Devils Pass Cabin is one of them. Visitors enjoy exploring the trail and viewing abundant wildlife found in the area. Fishing is available in a variety of nearby lakes and creeks, although each requires a hike. Fishing equipment is not provided at the cabin.<br /><br />In season, visitors hunt for moose, black and brown bears, Dall sheep, mountain goats, caribou and wolves in the surrounding forest.  <h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16x16 log cabin can accommodate up to eight people, but sleeps four comfortably. It is equipped with wooden bunks, a table, benches and an efficient, clean-burning oil stove for heat. Visitors must bring #1 stove oil to heat the cabin; a minimum of one gallon of stove oil is recommended (one gallon will burn for approximately 10 hours on a medium heat setting). An outhouse is provided outside the cabin.<br /><br />There is no electricity, potable water, mattresses, bedding or cooking utensils at the cabin. Visitors should bring sleeping bags and pads, a cook stove, cooking gear, food and clothing, among other necessities. There is no firewood available near the cabin.",
