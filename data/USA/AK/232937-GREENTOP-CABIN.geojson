    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Greentop Cabin is located on the southwest tip of Yakobi Island within the West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness Area. The cabin was built in the 1940s by a fisherman. It is available year-round and makes an excellent base for experiencing this corner of Alaska with its many recreational options.<br /><br /> The cabin is remote. It is located approximately 41 miles west of Hoonah and 67 miles northwest of Sitka. It is accessible only by boat or float plane. The flight is 1 hour from Sitka or Juneau and the boat ride is 1 hour from Pelican.<br /><br /> This is a primitive cabin with no electricity, indoor plumbing or cell phone coverage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on relatively flat terrain near the rugged, rocky coastline of Yakobi Island. It is protected from the Pacific Ocean by Greentop Harbor. The surrounding area offers abundant seashore life and the beautiful scenery of West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness Area. <br /><br />Deer and brown bear frequent the area, and sea otters are sometimes seen (<a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety and precautions</a>).<h4>Recreation:</h4>There are excellent opportunities for sea kayaking and boating in the numerous coves and protected bays. However, there are rocks in the area, so boating and kayaking excursions should be planned for high tide. Consult <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9452649>local tide tables</a>.<br /><br />Fishing for king salmon is also a popular pastime.

A wood stove is provided for heat. Firewood is stocked in a wood shed. An outhouse is located close to the cabin.<br /><br />Drinking water is not available at the cabin, but water can be collected from a small stream nearby (<a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety</a>). It is recommended that visitors bring a supply of drinking water.<br /><br />Visitors should bring sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cook stove and cooking gear, lantern or flashlight, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter.
