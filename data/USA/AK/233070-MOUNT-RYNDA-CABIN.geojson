    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mount Rynda Cabin was built in 1963 and offers a back country experience in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage. It is located within the Stikine-LaConte Wilderness and is available year-round for recreational use and relaxation.<br /><br /> The site can be accessed by float plane or shallow draft boat, depending on conditions. A tide of 14 feet or higher is required to cross the Stikine River tide flats. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on moderately steep land on the riverbank at the base of Mount Rynda. It overlooks the confluence of Andrew Creek and Andrew Slough and is tucked into a forest of primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock. Gentle to moderate mountain slopes surround the area.<br /><br />Brown and black bears, moose, harbor seals, gulls and bald eagles are frequently seen around the cabin (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>). The Stikine River tide flats are a major stopover point in the spring and fall for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Two miles of slow-moving, clear water near the cabin provide ideal opportunities for canoeing or kayaking up Andrew Creek at river stages over 14 feet. Tide charts should be consulted before undertaking any Stikine River expedition.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a sleeping loft, to accommodate up to seven people. It is also equipped with a table with benches, an oil space heater (No.1 oil only), broom and an outhouse. The partially covered front porch has a built-in bench and a bear-proof locker for food storage.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from a creek just west of the cabin, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing No.1 stove oil, guests should pack a cook stove, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79195&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
