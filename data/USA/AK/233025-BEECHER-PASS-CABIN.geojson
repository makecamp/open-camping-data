    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Beecher Pass Cabin offers a remote and rustic place to stay while enjoying the coastal waters and forests of southeastern Alaska. It is available for reservations year-round, giving outdoor enthusiasts access to great hunting and fishing.<br /><br /> The Beecher Pass Cabin is accessible by boat or float plane. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located on the south side of Beecher Pass on the northwest shore of Woewodski Island. It sits on a gravel beach overlooking scenic Duncan Canal to the north. The surrounding terrain is forested, with occasional steep slopes. <br /><br />A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area, including martens, eagles, herons, deer and sea mammals. About 200 yards behind the cabins water source is an active beaver pond. Visitors are asked to be considerate of the states abundant biology and practice <a href=http://alaskacenters.gov/wildlife-etiquette.cfm>wildlife etiquette</a>.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Waterfowl hunting is fairly good in Duncan Canal, as is salmon and halibut fishing. Hunting is available as per state or federal hunting regulations; <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.main target=_blank>click here</a> for more information from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. A boat is necessary to access fishing areas (<a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451287>check local tide tables</a>). Fishing equipment and a boat are not provided.<br /><br />Woewodski Island had extensive mining in the 1930s, but only small amounts of gold were found before the vein was lost. Current mining claims and possible activity may be happening nearby on the island.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>hunter-style</a> cabin is equipped with four single wooden bunks, a table, benches, a wood stove for heat and an outhouse with a pit toilet. A covered deck overlooks the water. A broom, dust pan, axe and splitting maul are typically available, but may be missing or damaged. Firewood is generally available, but is not guaranteed. Firewood is for heating the cabin only, not for outdoor campfires.<br /><br /> No drinking water is available at the cabin. A small creek serves as a water source and is located 100 yards east of the cabin. Water taken from the creek must be boiled or treated prior to consumption.<br /><br />Visitors need to bring their own sleeping bags and pads, cook stove and cooking gear, towels, food, clothing and garbage bags, among other necessities. All trash and food must be packed out, and visitors are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78991&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin details and maps.",

    "FacilityDirections": "The cabin is accessible only by boat or float plane, at any tide, and is located on the south side of Beecher Pass on the north shore of Woewodski Island. From Petersburg, the cabin is 17 miles by float plane or 20 miles by boat. The boat route from Petersburg is over protected water, but includes one passage where attention to channel markers is essential. The route from Wrangell crosses Sumner Strait, which can be very rough in windy weather. Boats can be anchored anywhere in front of the cabin.<br /><br />Refer to USGS topographic map Petersburg C4. <a href=http://ask.usgs.gov/to_order.html>Maps</a> are available online or by calling the Petersburg Ranger District at (907) 772-3871.",
