    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Trollers Cove Cabin offers recreation, relaxation and a unique Alaskan lodging experience on Prince of Wales Island in the Tongass National Forest. The remote site offers a scenic setting for fishing, hunting and wildlife viewing.<br /><br />The site is accessible by boat or floatplane. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Trollers Cove Cabin is located in a protected cove surrounded by flat, coastal terrain and an old-growth forest of cedar, spruce and hemlock. At low tide, a 50-foot tidal flat emerges at the cove, exposing rock and boulders.<br /><br />Small lakes dot the rolling terrain behind cabin and waterfalls plunge in nearby coves. North of the cabin, Spiral Cove is known for its scenic landscapes.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area is abundant, including eagles, shorebirds, Sitka black-tailed deer and black bears. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Trollers Cove offers anglers opportunities for bottom fishing and salmon trolling off 20 Fathom Bank. It is also used as anchorage by commercial and pleasure boats.<br /><br />Hunters can take advantage of the long hunting season in the surrounding national forest. Bear season occurs during spring and fall, while deer season begins in late summer and lasts through the late fall.<br /><br />Hikers will enjoy exploring many of the primitive trails extending from the cabin, showcasing nearby lakes and waterfalls. Since trails are not designated, visitors should become familiar with their surroundings and utilize good map and orienteering skills.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 14x14-ft cedar, <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a> log cabin sleeps up to four people on wooden bunkbeds without mattresses and a sleeping loft. The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, a wood stove for heat and an outside toilet. Other amenities include a cooking counter, shelves, cupboard space, fire extinguisher, axe, splitting maul and a broom. Firewood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed. <br /><br />The cabin does not have running water or electricity. Visitors must bring their own food, water, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cook stove, stove fuel, fire starter, cooking gear/utensils, light source, toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags. Water is available from the creek, but must be filtered, boiled or chemically treated before drinking. <br /><br />An unimproved boat ramp at nearby Polk Inlet is available for launching small craft to reach the cabin.
