    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Martin Lake Cabin offers guests a remote lodging experience in the Chugach National Forest in southeastern Alaska. Located on the northwest end of Martin Lake, 42 miles east of Cordova, the cabin offers guests year-round recreation and relaxation. Fishing, hunting and wildlife viewing are within walking distance of the cabin.<br /><br />Access to the cabin is by float plane only, typically 30 minutes from  Cordova. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated at the outlet of Martin Lake. At the front of the cabin, alder and willow marsh provide habitat for waterfowl. Mountain goats navigate the ridge line of steep mountains rising from behind the cabin.<br /><br />Sitka black-tailed deer, moose, black and brown bear are also abundant in the area.

The outlet stream is a good place to catch salmon and trout species. The inlet streams along the shore and at the far end of the lake are good places to fish for coho salmon. Dolly Varden follow the spawning salmon to eat any stray eggs. Cutthroat and rainbow trout hybrids are in the lakes and creeks in lesser numbers.<br /><br />A rowboat is available for cabin users; however, visitors may wish to rent a long shaft motor in Cordova to get to the far end of the lake. Visitors are responsible for bringing and using life vests.<br /><br />Hunters can take advantage of a long hunting season in the surrounding national forest. Bear season occurs during spring and fall, while deer season begins in late summer and lasts through late fall. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is a 12-by-14 foot rustic structure equipped with wooden bunks that sleep up to six guests. It is furnished with a table, benches, wood stove, oil stove, saw, axe, splitting maul, a rainwater catchment barrel and an outdoor pit toilet.<br /><br /> The cabin does not have running water, electricity, cut firewood or heating oil. Visitors must bring their own supply of drinking water, firewood and #1 stove oil for the oil stove.<br /><br />Visitors must bring food, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cook stove, matches, cooking gear, lanterns or flashlights, toilet paper, a first aid kit and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and visitors are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.",
