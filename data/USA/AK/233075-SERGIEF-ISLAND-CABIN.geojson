    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Sergief Island Cabin was built in 1962 and is located on the northwest side of Sergief Island on the Stikine River delta. The cabin is available for year-round recreational use and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage, and it makes an ideal base camp for exploring the surrounding Stikine-LeConte Wilderness.<br /><br />The site can only be accessed by a shallow draft boat or float plane, depending on conditions. The tide must be a minimum of 15 feet for boats and 17 feet for planes in order to access the cabin. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated between tidal grass flats and a forest of spruce and hemlock. A small stream flows about 75 feet away, and behind the cabin are low-forested hills.<br /><br /> The surrounding area is relatively flat with grass, shrubs, willow and alder. Wildflowers are prominent in May and June.<br /><br />This area is home to brown and black bears, bald eagles, hawks and moose (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). The Stikine River tidal flats are a major stopover spot for waterfowl and shorebirds during the spring and fall migrations.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The waters around the cabin are ideal for exploring by kayak or canoe during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12-by-14 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) has two single and two double bunks, to sleep up to four people. The cabin is also equipped with a table and benches, broom, oil heater and an outhouse. A wooden cooler box for food storage is located on the covered deck.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water may be available from a catchment, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service.
