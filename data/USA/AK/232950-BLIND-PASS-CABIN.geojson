    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Blind Pass Cabin sits on the northwest shore of Hassler Island, on Blind Pass. This secluded retreat is open year-round and makes an ideal base camp for exploring the various bays and inlets in the northern Behm Canal area.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by float plane, boat or kayak, depending on conditions. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is tucked into a sheltered cove, surrounded by old-growth forest. Low tides reveal a long beach in front of the cabin, and there is an adjacent stream. Guestshave views of Blind Pass and densely forested Black Island, which makes up the opposite shore.<br /><br /> Wildlife in the area include Sitka black-tailed deer, black bears and wolves (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>). A variety of waterfowl and marine mammals may be seen in Blind Pass. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The area is noted for king salmon runs into the Unuk River, with other salmon species, halibut, red snapper, Dungeness crab and shrimp also in abundance. A freshwater lake with trout is located about a half-mile upstream from the cabin. There is no trail to the lake.<br /><br />Sea kayaking is a popular mode of transportation, and many kayakers use this cabin as a base for exploring Bell Island, Gedney Pass and Bell Arm. It is also possible to kayak to Bailey Bay and hike to the Lake Shelokum Hot Springs. Guests must supply their own equipment and should consult <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9450836>local tide tables</a> before departing.<br /><br />Hunting is also possible in designated seasons with a permit.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 12-by-4 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a>) has two single bunks and two double bunks, to sleep up to six people.
