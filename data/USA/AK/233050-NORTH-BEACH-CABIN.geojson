    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>North Beach Cabin is nestled just inside the forest fringe on the north beach of Shelikof Bay on Kruzof Island, 20 miles northwest of Sitka, Alaska. The A-frame cabin is available year-round, weather permitting, and was built in 1993 by volunteers from the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka and by local volunteers. The Shelikof Cabin is located on the east shore of Shelikof Bay just south of the Shelikof River, about a mile from this cabin.<br /><br />This is a remote site. The cabin can be accessed by boat, a 45-minute ride from Sitka to Mud Bay, followed by a 7.5 mile hike or off-highway vehicle ride on old logging roads. The cabin can also be reached by helicopter at lower tides.<br /><br />Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin has spectacular views of the cresting waves on the outside coast of the Gulf of Alaska. It is surrounded by a hemlock and spruce forest and sits just above a sandy beach. The terrain is relatively flat and easy to explore. Brown bear frequent the area. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Beachcombing, photography, hiking, hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing and riding off-highway vehicles are popular activities at North Beach Cabin. Nearly 40 miles of old logging roads are open to hiking, mountain biking and off-highway vehicle riding. Fishing is fair for Dolly Varden trout, coho and pink salmon found in local streams.<br /><br />For information about fishing permits and seasons, visit the <a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16 x 16 wood <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame</a> cabin can accommodate up to eight people with a double plywood bunk bed and a sleeping loft reached by climbing a vertical ladder. An oil stove for heat, a table with benches, a cooking counter, cupboard, broom and an axe or splitting maul are provided. An outhouse toilet is close to the cabin.<br /><br />The cabin does not include mattresses, cooking utensils or heating oil. Visitors should bring #1 diesel fuel (generally 10 gallons for a three-day stay, more of less depending on the time of year), sleeping bags and pads, a cooking stove, pots, pans, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, a lantern, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and fire starter. Rain gear and boots are recommended. <br /><br />Water is available from a creek at a crossing about 1/3-mile from the cabin, but must be treated before using. Its recommended that visitors bring their own water.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79108&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for more cabin information and maps.",
