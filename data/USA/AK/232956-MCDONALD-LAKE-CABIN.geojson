The cabin is available year-round and makes an excellent base for experiencing this corner of Alaska with its many recreational options and abundant wildlife.<br /><br /> The cabin is remote and accessible only by boat or float plane, depending on conditions. Visitors arriving by boat must anchor at Yes Bay and walk the 1.5-mile McDonald Lake Trail to get to the cabin.<br /><br />  This primitive cabin has no electricity, indoor plumbing or cell phone coverage. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is backed by old-growth cedar, Sitka spruce and Western hemlock rainforest. From the front deck, visitors can gaze out over the lake and its forested shoreline, as well as admire the surrounding mountain peaks.<br /><br />Wildlife in the area includes Sitka black-tailed deer, black and brown bear, wolf, beaver, marten, mink and otter (<a href=  http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety and precautions</a>).
