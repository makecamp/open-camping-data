    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Windfall Lake Cabin, built in 1998, is the most used cabin on the Tongass National Forest. This rustic retreat is open year-round and is open as an overnight accommodation and a warming hut for winter recreationists. The cabin is an ideal base for enjoying the serenity and beauty of Windfall Lake or participating in various recreational activities.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by the Windfall Lake Trail or floatplane, depending on conditions. Winter weather may require a 3-mile trek on snowshoes or skis. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on the eastern end of Windfall Lake, just off the shore. The front deck overlooks the crystal-clear water and offers views of the surrounding mountains and dense evergreen forest.<br /><br />  Bears are frequent visitors to the area, and visitors may see beavers and a variety of waterfowl on the lake. Berries grow in the area and are available for picking in the summer. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The partially planked trail leading to the cabin has an elevation gain of 100 feet, appealing to hikers, snowshoers and skiers of all levels. Cross-country skiing is good in winter on an undeveloped trail route to Spaulding Meadows (map and compass are recommended).<br /><br />Visitors can bring canoes or kayaks to explore Windfall Lake, and must bring their own flotation devices. Salmon and trout fishing in Windfall Creek and Windfall Lake is possible with a state fishing license.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 14x16-ft. <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>pan-abode style</a> cabin sleeps six people with two single and two double bunks. The cabin also has a table and benches, broom, wood stove, axe and splitting maul. <br /><br />The cabin is accessible, with an elevated boardwalk connecting the dock, cabin and outhouse.
