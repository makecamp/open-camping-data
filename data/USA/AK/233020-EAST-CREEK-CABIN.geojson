    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>East Creek Cabin is a remote, rustic cabin on the Kenai Peninsula of south-central Alaska. It gives visitors a primitive camping experience amid spectacular scenery. In additional to miles of trails available for exploration, the cabin provides access to opportunities for big game hunting and wildlife viewing.<br /><br />The facility can only be accessed by hiking, horseback riding, skiing or snowshoeing at least 11.5 miles or longer, depending on weather conditions. The trail is open to snowmobiles every other year. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is north of Sterling Highway in the Resurrection Creek Valley. It is in a fairly level area, surrounded by a spruce and birch forest with views of nearby mountains and meadows. A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area. Berries ripen mid-July through mid-September.<br /><br />For more information on access and regulations pertaining to this cabin, trail conditions, safety precautions and <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r10/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety and ethics</a>, please contact the Seward District office.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, cross country skiing and snowshoeing along Resurrection Pass Trail are popular activities. Active mining operations are on private claims of the creek, yet there are designated areas for the public to pan for gold along the trail. <br /><br />In season, visitors hunt for moose, black and brown bears, Dall sheep, mountain goats, caribou and wolves in the surrounding forest. Fishing in the area is not great.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14-ft cabin can accommodate up to eight people, but sleeps four more comfortably. It is equipped with wooden bunks, a table, benches and a wood stove for heat. A splitting maul and crosscut saw are available. An outhouse is provided outside the cabin.<br /><br />There is no electricity, potable water, mattresses, bedding, cooking utensils or cut firewood at the cabin. Guests should bring sleeping bags and pads, a cook stove, cooking gear and food. Water taken from the creek should be treated or boiled before consumption.",
