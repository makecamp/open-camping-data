    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Lower Paradise Lake Cabin offers a remote and secluded place to stay in the scenic forest of southe-central Alaska. It provides spectacular glacier views, as well as ample opportunity for fishing on an unpeopled alpine lake. Visitors also enjoy hunting and wildlife viewing.<br /><br />The cabin is accessible by floatplane and access is extremely difficult in the winter when the lake freezes. Access is possible on the Ptarmigan Creek Trail, through the Snow River Pass and then down to the lake, but the trail is not maintained and very difficult. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located east of Seward Highway in the remote Paradise Valley on the north shore of Lower Paradise Lake. It sits in a forest of alder, willow and pine trees at an elevation of about 1,340 feet. A trail to the cabin is not maintained, but offers very scenic views. Wild berries are ripe for the picking in late-summer to fall and the area is home to abundant wildflowers in spring and early-summer.<br /><br />For more information on access and regulations pertaining to this cabin, trail conditions, safety precautions and <a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r10/learning/safety-ethics>outdoor safety and ethics</a>, please contact the Seward District office.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The cabin offers seclusion and good fishing. A rowboat and oars provided at the cabin give anglers excellent opportunities to catch grayling in the small, adjacent lake. Life jackets are not provided.<br /><br />Hunting is popular during designated seasons. The area is home to a variety of wildlife, including moose, black and brown bears and mountain goats. <br /><br />While there are no groomed trails in the area, it is rife with potential for exploration. Day hikes lead to even better views of glacier fields that loom above the cabin. Some glaciers can be seen out the front door of the cabin.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14-ft rustic cabin has wooden bunks and sleeps four people comfortably, but can accommodate up to eight. It is equipped with a table, benches and a wood stove for heat. An outdoor toilet is provided. Firewood is not plentiful in the region.<br /><br />Visitors will need to bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes. Water taken from the lake must be treated or boiled prior to consumption. Visitors will also need to bring their own bedding and sleeping pads, flashlights, cooking gear, food, clothing and cooking utensils, among other necessities. All garbage and food must be packed out.",
