    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Harding River Cabin was built in 1978 and offers year-round recreation and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage. The cabin is ideally located near excellentfishing and crabbing spots. It is also in a prime spot for viewing birds and wildlife.<br /><br />The site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Boats and planes should anchor in deeper water, and guests should take small skiffs or puntsto the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on relatively flat land overlooking the Harding River and Bradfield Canal. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock with scattered cedar. Muskeg is also common in the area.<br /><br /> Brown and black bears, harbor seals and bald eagles are often spotted around the cabin (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bearsafety information</a>). A lucky few may spot gray whales swimming in the nearby waters. The upper end of Bradfield Canal is a spring and fall stop for migratorywaterfowl.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Anglers can fish in the Harding River for cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden from May through September, steelhead in April and May, and silver chum salmon in August and September. Bradfield Canal offers excellent crabbing, but <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9450970>tide charts</a> should be consulted before planning any boating or crabbing excursions.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This 14-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>hunter-style</a>) has two single bunks and two double bunks to sleep up to six people. It is also equipped with a table and benches, broom, an oil stove for heat (No. 1 oil only) and an outhouse toilet.

Water is available from the Harding River, but guests should be sure to treat or boil any water taken from an outside source, prior to consumption (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service.
