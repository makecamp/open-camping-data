    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Goose Bay Cabin is open year-round for recreation, relaxation and sightseeing on Prince William Sound. This is a prime spot for winter recreationists, but a variety ofactivities are offered throughout the year for backcountry enthusiasts.<br /><br /> This remote site can be accessed by a 45-minute float plane trip from Anchorage or a boat ride from Whittier, depending on conditions. In mid-November, the bay freezes over, making transportation to the cabin a challenge. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Goose Bay is at the head of a narrow waterway on the east side of Culross Passage. The cabin is tucked into a small lagoon on the east side of Goose Bay on the western shore of Culross Island. Fragile muskeg, tall grasses and evergreen trees surround the cabin. Views from the front porch reveal a small waterfall and the gentle, evergreen-forested slopes across the bay.<br /><br />Visitors to the area may see bald eagles soaring overhead or catch a glimpse of a brown bear (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>learn about bear safety</a>). Lucky guests may spot Orcas or Dalls porpoises frolicking in the waters of Prince William Sound on the approach to Goose Bay.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The area around Goose Bay offers year-round recreational opportunities. Hiking and kayaking are popular summer pastimes. <br /><br /> The terrain on Culross Island attracts telemark and cross-country skiers in winter and early spring, as well as snowshoers. A ski or snowshoe adventure to the high point on Culross Island offers spectacular views of Prince William Sound and the jagged, glaciated peaks of the Chugach Range.<br /><br /> The cabin makes a good base for fishing and shrimping expeditions in Culross Passage. Deer hunting is good here in the fall.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 12x14 foot cabin sleeps 6 and comes equipped with wooden bunks, a table, benches, a propane stove for heat and an outside pit toilet.<br /><br /> The facility does meet accessibility standards, but the ramp leading to the cabin from the water is only wheelchair-accessible during high tide. At low tide, guests may have to walk through some mud to get to the ramp from the water. Propane may be available onsite during the summer season only (June-August). <br /><br />No electricity or water is available. Guests need to bring their own supply of drinking water, as well as propane between October and mid-May. The propane stove has the same hookup as a standard gas barbecue grill.<br /><br /> Items such as a cook stove, lanterns or flashlights, bedding, sleeping pads, cooking gear, garbage bags and toilet paper and not provided. All trash must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before departure.",

    "FacilityDirections": "Boat access: Goose Bay is approximately 25 miles southeast of Whittier in Prince William Sound. From Whittier Harbor, head east out of Passage Canal and across Port Wells. Head south into Culross Passage.  Goose Bay is at the head of a narrow passage on the east side of Culross Passage directly across from Long Bay. The cabin is located near a small waterfall on the east side of the bay.<br /><br /> Parts of Goose Bay can be more challenging to navigate in low tide, especially the area in front of the cabin, which may get too shallow. High slack tide is ideal for boating. Be sure to <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9454825>check local tide reports</a> prior to your arrival.<br /><br />Access via floatplane is approximately 45 minutes from Anchorage.",
