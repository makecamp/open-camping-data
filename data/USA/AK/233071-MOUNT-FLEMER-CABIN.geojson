    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mount Flemer Cabin was built in 1963, near the confluence of Clearwater Slough and the Stikine River. It is only two miles from the border between the United States and Canada and is available for year-round recreational use and relaxation in Alaskas beautiful Inside Passage. The cabin is located within the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness and offers spectacular views.<br /><br /> The site can be accessed by a shallow draft boat, depending on conditions. The tide must be at least 14 feet in order to cross the Stikine River tide flats. Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on moderately steep land at the base of Mount Flemer, among a stand of spruce trees on the bank of the Stikine River. Guests can enjoy spectacular views along the river, towards the border, including Elbow and Whitehead Mountains and others in the Coast Range. The backdrop of this area is faces of steep, granite rock.<br /><br /> The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock. Cottonwood is found extensively along the rivers edge throughout the valley.<br /><br />Brown and black bears, moose and mountain goats are common to this area (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livingwithbears.bearcountry>bear safety information</a>). The Stikine River tide flats are a major stopover point in the spring and fall for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The waters around the cabin are ideal for navigating by kayak, canoe or shallow draft boats during high tide. The Forest Service does not provide boats, and guests must also bring their own flotation devices. <a href=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=9451204>Tide tables</a> should be consulted before any boating excursion.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The 16-by-16 cabin (<a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame style</a>) has two single bunks (one with a trundle bed) and a sleeping loft to accommodate up to seven people. It is also equipped with a table with benches, an oil heater (No.1 oil only), a broom and an outhouse. The partially covered front porch has a built-in bench and a bear-proof locker for food storage.<br /><br />Water and electricity are not provided. Water is available from an adjacent stream, but guests should be sure to treat water before drinking or cookingwith it (<a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety tips</a>). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply.<br /><br />Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing No.1 stove oil, guests should pack a cook stove, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving (<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79194&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>click here</a> for more cabin details).",
