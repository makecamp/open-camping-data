    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Avoss Lake Cabin is situated 35 air miles southeast of Sitka, Alaska, within the South Baranof Wilderness Area of the Tongass National Forest. The rustic A-frame cabin makes an excellent base for a remote backcountry experience that includes photography and hunting.<br /><br />The cabin is accessed via a 30-minute float plane trip from Sitka, weather permitting. Visitors cannot access the cabin by helicopter, as it is located in a designated wilderness area. From the lake shore, visitors must walk along a narrow, 150-foot trail through a lightly wooded area to reach the cabin.<br /><br />Visitors are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The area offers wilderness solitude and beauty. The cabin sits just off the northern shore of Avoss Lake at an elevation of 800 feet at the edge of a muskeg near an inlet stream to Avoss Lake. The lake is about 1.5 miles long and nearly half a mile wide. The cabin is five miles northeast of Whale Bay on the south central portion of Baranof Island.<br /><br />Many streams and small channels flow through the surrounding area. Wildflowers bloom in abundance during spring and summer.<br /><br />Brown bear frequent the area.

From July to September, anglers may catch Dolly Varden and rainbow trout, although the fishing is slow.<br /><br />Deer and mountain goat hunting is possible in season. This area is remote, rugged and surrounded by steep, mountainous terrain. Plan hunting trips accordingly.<br /><br />For information about fishing and hunting permits and seasons, visit the <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=license.main>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The <a href=http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml>A-frame</a> cabin measures 16 by 16 feet. It contains a sleeping loft that is reached by climbing a vertical  ladder. The cabins lower level is furnished with one double plywood bunk and one single plywood bunk (no mattresses), a table and chairs, a cooking counter and a broom. An outhouse toilet is provided.<br /><br />The cabin is equipped with an oil stove for heat, but oil is not provided. Visitors must bring their own supply of #1 diesel oil (10 gallons for a 3-day stay, more or less depending on the time of year).

It is recommended visitors bring their own supply of water. Learn about <a href=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=hunting.water>water safety</a>.<br /><br />A small but heavy, square-bowed skiff (rowboat) with oars is provided. A long-shaft outboard motor in the 2-10 hp range is highly recommended for use with the skiff, but is not provided. Each person using the skiff should have a Coast Guard approved personal floatation device (PFD). Tie the skiff well up on the shore and pull the plug before leaving so the boat does not fill with rain water. <br /><br /><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=79058&amp;actid=101 target=_blank>Click here</a> for maps and additional cabin information.",
