    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Lower Fir Group Area is a high-energy and highly popular group campground in the Sacramento Mountain area.  The site is set away from public roads, so that outside noise is non-existent, leaving only the sweet sounds of rustling aspen leaves. <p>The campground sits within the Lincoln National Forest, which spans 1.1 million acres of undisturbed landscape. Spend your days exploring the mountain trails, or head west for a day trip to White Sands National Monument, the worlds largest dune field of pure, white gypsum sand. Bring your camera and binoculars for the chance to observe wild elk, deer, birds, and even an occasional black bear. </p><h4>Natural Features:</h4>Lower Fir Group sits at a high elevation of 9,000 ft., providing visitors with dramatic views of the Tularosa Basin and lush mountain meadows surrounded by pine, fir, aspen and oak trees. <h4>Recreation:</h4>An open meadow, ideal for activities like volleyball or horseshoes, is adjacent to the campground. The Rim Trail is a short hike or drive away, offering epic views, rocky inclines, and switchbacks for adventurous mountain bikers, hikers, and horse-back riders. A few miles south, the same trail opens up to motorcyclists as well. <h4>Facilities:</h4>This is one of the only group sites with water access. Lower Fir comfortably fits groups as large as 70, and its connected to Upper Fir Group, and even larger facility accommodating up to 120 visitors. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The campground is a mile from the village of Cloudcroft, a quaint mountain town with New Mexicos only standing railroad trestle. Trails for ATVs are near the area, too.",
