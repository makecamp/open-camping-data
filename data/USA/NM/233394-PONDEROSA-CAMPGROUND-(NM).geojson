    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>For guests to Bandelier National Monument, Ponderosa Campground is an ideal place to stay. Located 6 miles from the main park entrance, the campground is just a short drive from the main visitor center, the Frijoles Canyon Shuttle System and the adjacent town of Los Alamos.<br /><br /> Ponderosa Campground is open year-round. The canyon and most of the parks trails are only accessible by shuttle bus during designated periods, but guests can access those areas by vehicle the remainder of the year. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Bandelier National Monument protects over 33,000 acres of rugged, beautiful canyon and mesa country as well as evidence of a human presence here going back over 11,000 years. Petroglyphs, dwellings carved into the soft rock cliffs and standing masonry walls pay tribute to the early days of a culture that still survives in the surrounding communities.<br /><br /> The park is home to over 55 species of mammals including mule deer, Aberts squirrels, mountain lions and 16 species of bats. Black bears have also been seen in the park. Birds such as Stellers jays, canyon towhees and mountain chickadees stay year-round, whereas turkey vultures, western tanagers and black-headed grosbeaks are summer-only residents.  <h4>Recreation:</h4>Hikers can access one trail directly from the facility. The Ponderosa Trail descends into the park through ponderosa pine forest and leads 8 miles through Frijoles Canyon to the visitor center and Main Loop Trail. The visitor center and over 70 miles of trails can be accessed by car, about 9 miles from the campground.<br /><br /> Most visitors begin their exploration of Bandelier with a walk on the Main Loop Trail. This short 1.2 mile loop trail starts from the visitor center and leads through excavated archeological sites on the floor of Frijoles Canyon. A portion of this trail is accessible.<br /><br /> Other trails in this area include the 3-mile round-trip Falls Trail to beautiful Upper Falls, and various trails of different lengths and difficulties leading up to the mesa tops.<br /><br /> Although rock climbing is prohibited in Bandelier, many popular climbs are within a short drive up Route 4 into the Jemez Mountains.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Vault toilets, drinking water, a picnic shelter and picnic tables are provided at this facility. Food storage lockers and campfire rings are available. These sites are tent-only, but one RV per site can be accommodated in the parking area. No hookup campsites are available. Each site can accommodate between 10 and 50 people.<br /><br />  Sites can be reserved for large group picnics from 11:30 a.m. until 4 p.m.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The town of Los Alamos has shopping, museums, amenities, a movie theater, ice rink and ski hill. The YMCA and a swimming pool both have showers for campers. Nearby Department of Energy and Forest Service lands provide trails which accommodate pets.",
