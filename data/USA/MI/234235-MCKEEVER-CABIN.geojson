    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>McKeever Cabin is located in the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigans Upper Peninsula, approximately 14 miles south of Munising, Michigan. The Cabin was constructed in 1991 and overlooks the 132-acre McKeever Lake. <br /><br />While the facility offers little in the way of modern amenities, convenient access to a number of recreational activities, including hunting, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, swimming and cross-country skiing, make this cabin a desirable destination for the outdoors enthusiast.<br /><br />During warmer months, visitors may park their vehicle and access the cabin by foot via a 1,000 ft. trail.  When snow is present, the cabin may be accessed by snowshoe or cross-country skis via a 1-mile trail.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is situated on a small knoll surrounded by young evergreens and hardwood trees, overlooking the western shores of McKeever Lake. The lake was stocked with northern muskie in 1990, but also supports a good population of northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bluegill.<br /><br />The Big Island Lake Wilderness is located near the cabin and features 23 small lakes ranging in size from 5 to 149 acres. White birch, maple and aspen cover the wooded hills that surround the lakes. Berries, mushrooms and wildflowers grow throughout the area and a wide range of wildlife and waterfowl, including sensitive species, may be carefully observed here. <h4>Recreation:</h4>During winter months, visitors can enjoy the McKeever Hills Ski Trail, which offers a quieter, less manicured alternative to highly groomed trails without sacrificing quality. The trail to the cabin connects directly to the ski trail, so visitors can ski right out the cabin door. <br /><br />The Bruno&rsquo;s Run Trail offers a 9 mile (14.48 km) loop ideal for hiking and mountain biking in spring, summer and fall and snow shoeing in winter. Although the trail is not groomed for cross-country skiing, it does offer a suitable source for experienced skiers who prefer to break their own way.<br /><br />Seasonal activities also include swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing on the lake as well as hunting in designated areas. See the Michigan Department of Natural Resources website for information about <a href=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10363_14518---,00.html>hunting seasons and permits</a>.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can accommodate up to four people comfortably and a maximum of six people. There are two sets of bunk beds (with 4 mattresses), one table with stools, one counter top, one corner seat and a wood burning stove. There is no longer a loft with a mattress in this cabin.<br /><br />There are no modern bathroom facilities or electricity offered at this cabin. In order to ensure a comfortable stay, visitors must bring several of their own supplies including a camp stove, dishes, cooking utensils, containers for carrying water, toilet paper, lanterns, sleeping bags and pillows.<br /><br />A pit toilet is located just off the trail to the cabin and there is a (summer/winter) hand pump with drinking water located down the trail to the lake. Do not bring firewood from home: all firewood will be supplied at the cabin.",
