    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Upper Hospital Flat is a great place for groups to escape the summer heat of surrounding deserts and retreat to a scenic meadow in the Pinale&ntilde;o Mountains of southeastern Arizona. The area is known for camping, scenic driving, picnicking, birding, wildlife viewing, hiking, mountain biking and history.<br /><br />In the 1880s, the campground served as the site for a field hospital for ailing soldiers from nearby Fort Grant, hence its name. The restorative powers of this cool, high-elevation location also attracted officers and their families seeking a summer refuge from desert heat. Today, Hospital Flat serves as popular getaway for outdoor enthusiasts and campers.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground sits along Big Creek in a mixed conifer forest, adjacent to a meadow that comes to life with wildflower blooms in late summer. The 9,000-ft. elevation offers pleasant summer temperatures.<br /><br />The Coronado National Forest covers 1.78 million acres of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Elevations range from 3,000 to 10,720 feet in 12 widely scattered mountain ranges, or &quot;sky islands,&quot; that rise dramatically from the desert floor, supporting biologically diverse plant communities.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The scenic and relaxing setting is inviting for an afternoon picnic, as well as bird and wildlife watching. A .75-mile nature trail gives interpretive information about the meadow and its plant and animal inhabitants.<br /><br />The campground lies along the Swift Trail scenic drive, which takes visitors from the Sonoran Desert to alpine meadows and forests on the Pinale&ntilde;o Range. Several points of interest offer excellent side trips, including Heliograph Peak.<br /><br />The road also provides access to a number of hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking trails, a mountain lake stocked with trout and several campgrounds.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Hospital Flat offers one reservable group site for up to 50 people and several first-come, first-served individual sites. The facility is equipped with a picnic table, parking area and campfire ring with a grill. A vault toilet restroom is located just across the street from the group area, at the main Hospital Flat campground.<br /><br />The road leading into the group site is mainly suitable for higher-clearance vehicles.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Mount Graham Wilderness Study Area, which includes the 10,720-foot Mount Graham and several trails, is close by.",
