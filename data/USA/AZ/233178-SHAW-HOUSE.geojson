    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Shaw House is a stone cabin located in the east Cochise Stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains of Coronado National Forest. The house is nestled in a dramatic landscape of canyons, rock formations, and the shade of several large cottonwood trees, offering guests to the area a unique lodging experience. Nearby trails provide excellent hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding opportunities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Shaw House is surrounded by the rugged beauty of the Cochise Stronghold in Coronado National Forest. West of Sunsites, Arizona in the Dragoon Mountains, this sparsely wooded area is a protective rampart of granite spires, sheer cliffs, balanced rocks and boulders, which were once the refuge of Apache Chief, Cochise.<br /><br />The area is abundant with wildlife, including white-tailed and mule deer, rabbits, wild turkeys, and squirrels. Bats, black bear, Coati, foxes, ring-tailed cats, bobcats, and mountain lion find habitat in the area as well, but are more often seen in the twilight and nocturnal hours. <h4>Recreation:</h4>With rugged granite formations, wooded slopes, seasonal streams, and an amazing variety of plants and wildlife, the Cochise Stronghold area is a popular recreational destination.<br /><br /> Rock climbing is long standing in the area, boasting backcountry and protected routes ranging from one to seven pitches in length, and from 5.6 to 5.12 in difficulty. Most approaches are 30-60 minutes in length, although there are a number of known areas that are easily accessible from the roads.<br /><br />Birders congregate in southeastern Arizona as it is touted as one of the countrys revered birding areas. With fifteen species of hummingbirds, 36 species of wood warblers, and over 256 documented bird species, the area is a birders paradise.<br /><br />Nearby trails provide excellent hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding opportunities. <h4>Facilities:</h4>Shaw House is an eight room house, suitable for groups of up to 10 people.
