    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Treasure Park North sits along the scenic Swift Trail in southern Arizona. The picturesque mountain meadow setting provides an escape from the desert heat and opportunities for viewing wildlife and wildflowers, as well as group camping, hiking, mountain biking and picnicking.<br /><br />The location boasts an interesting history. Legend has it that a treasure of stolen gold and silver was buried here by a band of outlaws in the 1850s. They reportedly marked the site with a triangle formed by three colored granite stones, though no buried treasure was ever found.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>This site lies within the mixed conifer area of the Pinale&ntilde;o Mountains at an elevation of 9,000 ft. The high elevations makes this area very pleasant in summer compared to the heat of lower deserts.<br /><br />The Coronado National Forest covers 1.78 million acres of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Elevations range from 3,000 to 10,720 feet in 12 widely scattered mountain ranges, or &quot;sky islands,&quot; that rise dramatically from the desert floor, supporting biologically diverse plant communities.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The campground lies along the Swift Trail scenic drive, which takes visitors from the Sonoran Desert at 2,900 feet to alpine meadows and forests on the 9,000-foot ridges of the Pinale&ntilde;o Range. Several points of interest offer excellent side trips, including a hike to Heliograph Peak and a visit to Hospital Flat, a meadow that blooms with wildflowers in late summer.<br /><br />In addition to these points of interest, the road provides access to a number of hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking trails, a mountain lake stocked with trout as well as several campgrounds. Because of its diverse habitat, the area is known for birding and wildlife watching.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Treasure Park North can accommodate a single group of up to 100 people at a time. The site is equipped with a group campfire ring with grill, a parking area and a drinking water spigot nearby, with water available seasonally.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The Mount Graham Wilderness Study Area, which includes the 10,720-foot Mount Graham and several trails, is close by.",
