    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>This group campground is situated in a tall ponderosa pine forest, just down the road from the popular Woods Canyon Lake in north central Arizona. The shaded campground is a nice hideaway for large groups with opportunities for boaters, anglers, hikers, families and photographers. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is situated in a thick forest at an elevation of 7,500 feet. Wildlife viewing includes birds, squirrels, deer and elk. Hikers who venture onto nearby trails are afforded expansive views of the land beneath the Mogollon Rim. <br /><br />The Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as &quot;muggy-own,&quot; is a 200-mile long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 ft. in elevation and serves as the geographical divide between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below.<br /><br />Summer temperatures can be very pleasant because of the elevation. However, the rainy season often brings afternoon thunderstorms from late June through August. Visitors should come prepared for rain and cool nighttime temperatures.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Popular activities include trout fishing (both lake and stream), hiking, boating and photography. Woods Canyon Lake is one of seven lakes in the Rim Lakes Recreation Area, and one of the most visited. Two other lakes are within a short drive. Woods Canyon Lake only allows electric boat motors.<br /><br />The Rim Lakes Vista Trail is just a quarter mile from the campground and leads to spectacular views of the Mogollon Rim and surrounding area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground is arranged in two loops in a cul-de-sac design. Each has a group area that can host up to 110 campers and 26 vehicles (parallel parking only). The sites can accommodate both RVs and tents, though some areas are less suited for tent camping. A picnic shelter is located in the middle of the group use area.<br /><br />Groceries are available at the Woods Canyon Store, and a dump station is located near the park. Firewood is sold.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Gas, telephones and groceries are available in Forest Lakes 9 miles east. The nearest full service community is Payson, Arizona, 34 miles west on Highway 260.<br /><br />Visitors can explore endless vistas and take part in many outdoor activities in the surrounding Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which encompasses 2 million acres of magnificent mountain country in east-central Arizona and New Mexico.",
