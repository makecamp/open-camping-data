    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Woods Canyon Lake Group Area is located in north central Arizona near the town of Heber. The camp is adjacent to popular Woods Canyon Lake and situated in thick pine forests, providing a great getaway for large groups of up to 100 people. It offers plenty of activities for anglers, boaters, hikers, families and photographers.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Woods Canyon Lake is surrounded by a dense forest of pine, fir, oak and aspen, and sits at an elevation of 7,000 feet. Hikers who venture onto nearby trails are afforded expansive views of the land beneath the Mogollon Rim. The Mogollon Rim, pronounced by locals as &quot;muggy-own,&quot; is a 200-mile long cliff in northern Arizona that ranges between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation and serves as the geographical dividing line between the cool high country above and the hot, dry desert below.<br /><br />Summer temperatures can be very pleasant because of the elevation. However, the rainy season often brings afternoon thunderstorms from late June through August. Visitors should come prepared for rain and cool nighttime temperatures.<br /><br />Wildlife viewing includes birds, squirrels, deer and elk. Deer, skunks and bears are common campground visitors.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Woods Canyon Lake is one of seven lakes in the Rim Lakes Recreation Area, and one of the most visited. Trout fishing (both lake and stream) is a favorite pastime. Woods Canyon Lake only allows electric boat motors. Two other lakes are within a short drive.<br /><br />The Rim Lakes Vista Trail, less than a mile from the campground, and others in the area lead to spectacular views of the Mogollon Rim. An easy hiking trail meanders around the lake, and the paved roads in the recreation area make for great afternoon bike rides.<br /><br />Families might also enjoy attending educational programs given by Forest Service rangers on the weekends.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The group camping area is primitive but convenient to the lake. Vault toilets and drinking water are provided. The facility can comfortably accommodate 70 people, though the maximum is 100.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest full service community is Payson, Arizona, 35 miles west on Highway 260. <br /><br />Visitors can explore endless vistas and take part in many outdoor activities in the surrounding Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which encompasses 2 million acres of magnificent mountain country in east-central Arizona and New Mexico.",
