    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Turney Gulch is a remote, scenic location for groups of up to 100 people to rest under the stars and towering pines of Prescott National Forest. The site lies near Horsethief Lake and is seven miles southeast of the small town of Crown King, Arizona, a former ghost town. Campers can enjoy hunting, fishing, hiking, birding, wildlife viewing and visiting historic sites in the area. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The facility is situated in a ponderosa pine forest at an elevation of 6,000 feet in the Bradshaw Mountains of north-central Arizona. The forest is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including deer, mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes, fox, rabbits, lizards, snakes, bald eagles and other species of birds.<br /><br />Summer temperatures offer a pleasant relief from the heat of nearby deserts, and winter is cool to cold with occasional snow. Afternoon thunderstorms are possible from late June through mid-September.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Campers have no shortage of activities both in and around the campground. The shade of the ponderosas invites guests to picnic and relax at the facility, while the nearby lake allows fishing and boating (electric motors and oars only). Anglers cast for largemouth bass, channel catfish and sunfish. Hunting is available in the surrounding forest, and the nearby Castle Creek Wilderness provides numerous trails for hikers to explore.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Turney Gulch is the only group campground near Horsethief lake and close to one family campground. The facility has a rustic mountain feel with a picnic shelter, 15 picnic tables, a grill and accessible vault toilets. Drinking water and trash collection are provided for convenience.<br /><br />The site lies on an unimproved dirt road and the drive is difficult; campers should use high clearance vehicles to get there.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The small town of Crown King has a general store with basic supplies.",
