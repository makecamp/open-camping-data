    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Spring Valley Cabin and Bunkhouse offer a peaceful retreat with spectacular views, quiet solitude, wildlife viewing opportunities and access to cross country ski trails, all just minutes away from Flagstaff, and one hour from Grand Canyon National Park. This year-round getaway can host up to 14 people between the cabin and adjacent bunkhouse. The facility is popular among equestrian campers, as horses are allowed on the grounds.<br /><br />The facility can be accessed by vehicle, however, drive-in access may not be available in winter. Cross country ski access is available when conditions require it. The distance from the winter parking area to the cabin is one mile. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The structures are located at an elevation of 7,320 feet, overlooking a wide meadow while being being nestled beneath mature ponderosa pines. The cabin was constructed in 1917 as the residence for rangers who worked at the guard station. The bunkhouse served as the office. It is still occasionally used as a field station for U.S. Forest Service employees. <br /><br />Winter brings a mix of sun with cold temperatures and occasional winter storms. Summer temperatures are relatively pleasant, but weather can be unpredictable. Visitors should come prepared for changeable mountain weather, cold nights, thunderstorms and snow from fall through spring.<h4>Recreation:</h4>With miles upon miles of national forest and park lands to explore, visitors have no shortage of outdoor activities from which to choose. The cabin is adjacent to a cross country ski trail, which provides access to the cabin when the roads are covered in snow, and an area for snow tubing is nearby. <br /><br />Hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking are very popular in this area, and there are plenty of trails. Visitors might be lucky enough to spot wildlife such as elk, mule deer, wild turkeys, javelina, coyote and numerous birds and raptors that live in the area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The facility is made up of two buildings, a cabin and bunkhouse. The cabin is equipped with five twin beds and one queen bed, all with mattresses, to sleep up to seven people. A maximum of eight people is allowed within the cabin. There is a dining area, a restroom with flush toilet and shower, cleaning equipment, and a kitchen with drinking water and plenty of kitchen supplies. <br /><br />The bunkhouse offers five twin beds and one full size futon, all with mattresses available to sleep up to seven people. Gas/propane heaters, wood stoves and firewood are provided. A parking area, picnic tables and horse corral for up to four horses are located outside.<br /><br />Campers must bring their own food, bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets and/or sleeping bags), bath and kitchen towels, garbage bags, warm clothing, dish soap and flashlights, among other necessities. The facility must be cleaned and all food and trash removed prior to departure.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Grand Canyon National Parks South Rim is a must-see attraction just over an hour away. The nearby town of Williams and the city of Flagstaff have numerous restaurants, hotels, gift shops, grocery stores and cultural attractions.",
