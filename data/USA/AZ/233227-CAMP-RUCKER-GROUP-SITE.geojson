The group camping area offers mountain views and plenty of space for group camping for up to 150 people.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Located at an elevation of 5,533 feet, Camp Rucker is situated in a grassy area with plenty of open space between the oak, juniper and Arizona walnut trees that provide welcome shade on a summer day. <br><br>A short distance from the camp, Rucker Creek runs intermittently throughout the year. Monte Vista Peak to the northeast and a number of other minor peaks and foothills provide a scenic backdrop.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Rucker and Tex Canyon scenic drive takes visitors over the southern reaches of the Chiricahua Mountains through beautiful canyon country, several forest campgrounds and a number of trails into the Chiricahua Wilderness. History buffs might want to stop at the historic Rucker Military Camp and Ranch, a remnant of the regions warring between U.S. Cavalry and Chiricahua Apaches.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Camp Rucker has one spacious group campsite that includes eight picnic tables, two large serving tables, campfire rings with grills, bear-proof trash containers and vault toilets.<br><br>The site was designed for groups. However, if the area has not been reserved by a group, individuals are permitted to camp.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Campers can take a day trip to Chiricahua National Monument. The monument protects some of the most scenic areas of the Chiricahua Mountains, a wonderland of rocks and forests with many opportunities for hiking and photography.<br><br><a href=http://www.nps.gov/chir/index.htm TARGET=_blank>Click here</a> for more about the Chiricahua National Monument.",
