    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Caldwell Cabin allows up to six visitors to step back in time to a more rustic and historical era in eastern Arizona. Originally constructed in the 1920s, it was a one-room homestead, but the cabin was expanded around 1940, to include a bathroom, small bedroom and living room with a fireplace. Visitors can relax on the front porch and take in the scenic views, or head out for a day of nearby hiking, mountain biking or fishing.<br /><br />The cabin can be accessed by driving approximately 30 miles southwest of the town of Alpine. Some of the roads are gravel. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits at an elevation of 8,000 feet, in the White Mountains of Arizona. It is nestled among tall ponderosa pine trees and overlooks a large grassy meadow. Because of the high elevation, summer temperatures are pleasant and cool, providing a nice respite from the heat of lower deserts.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A short drive takes visitors to the Black River Mainstream Trail, which is great for mountain biking and hiking. The Black River is a popular fishing spot for trout anglers. From  the cabin, guests can watch the sunset from the front porch, dine by the fireplace or walk across the meadow to an overlook of the river.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin has many amenities to help visitors feel right at home. The kitchen is equipped with a table and chairs, propane stove, propane refrigerator, solar-powered lights, a sink and fold-down bed from the original homestead. Kitchen supplies include pots, pans, utensils, dishes, a coffeepot and can opener. <br />click here for more cabin details).<br /><br />There are two picnic tables and a campfire ring in front of the cabin, and two Adirondack chairs on the porch. Lawn chairs are not provided, but are a nice addition if guests would like to bring their own.<br /><br />Visitors must supply their own bedding (including pillows), towels, flashlights, garbage bags, dish washing supplies, toilet paper, food, axe for splitting firewood, and matches and newspaper for starting fires in the fireplace. The cabin has no electricity or phone. Extra warm clothes and rain gear are suggested.<br /><br />Users must pack out all food and trash and clean the cabin thoroughly, including dishes, floors and counters, prior to checking out of the cabin. Lights and appliances must also be turned off and the doors locked. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Visitors can explore endless vistas and take part in many outdoor activities in the surrounding Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which encompasses 2 million acres of magnificent mountain country in east-central Arizona and New Mexico.",
