The facility also served as a cattle ranch in the 1960s. <br /><br />The Forest Service acquired the land in 1989 and it has since become an ideal location for guests seeking a unique lodging experience, rich in mining and ranching history.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Spanning four life zones and several ecosystems between desert and mountain peaks, the area surrounding the camp and cabin is considered a &quot;sky island,&quot; supporting abundant and biologically diverse plant and animal communities.<br /><br />Mountain peaks, high desert grasslands, and seasonal streams provide diverse habitat for wildlife abundant in the area. White-tailed and mule deer, rabbits, wild turkeys, and squirrels are commonly seen, while black bear, Coati, foxes, ring-tailed cats, bobcats and the more elusive mountain lion.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding trails are popular in the area and vary from paved and gentle walking paths, to steep, strenuous trails leading to the top of 9,453-foot Mt.
