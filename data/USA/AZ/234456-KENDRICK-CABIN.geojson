    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Kendrick Cabin offers groups of up to 10 people the chance to experience spectacular mountain views, numerous hiking and mountain biking trails, and several cultural and historic attractions of the Southwest region. The rustic, three-bedroom masonry and wood cabin is a retired U.S. Forest Service fire guard station constructed in the 1960s. It lies just minutes from downtown Flagstaff and about an hour from the world-famous Grand Canyon National Park.<br /><br />Kendrick Cabin is located approximately 22 miles north of Flagstaff, in central Arizona. The site is typically accessible year-round, however, it may not be accessible in deep snow. All roads are suitable for a sedan except during winter months. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is located at an elevation of 7,910 feet, in the scenic Kendrick Park area at the base of the 12,000-ft. San Francisco Peaks, the remains of an old volcano. From the facility, visitors have wonderful views of the peaks, Kendrick Mountain and the surrounding forest, as well as the night sky on clear nights.<br /><br />The area is home to elk, deer, antelope, fox, coyotes, mountain lions, numerous birds and other animals.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Flagstaff area is a hub for hiking and mountain biking in warmer months and skiing in the winter. Dozens of trails are within a short drive of the cabin, including the scenic Kendrick Mountain Trail and several trails on the San Francisco Peaks. Bikes and off-road vehicles are allowed only on designated roads and trails.<br /><br />Families and photographers can enjoy a morning or evening walk along the Kendrick Park Watchable Wildlife Trail, which is adjacent to the cabin. Hunting is also available in many nearby areas within the Coconino national forest.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The multiple-room, two-story cabin is equipped with a solar lighting system, propane stovetop range, small refrigerator, dining area with a table and chairs, and a wood stove. Furniture includes one double bed in the downstairs bedroom and two twin beds in each of the two upstairs bedrooms. Kitchen supplies include pots, pans, utensils, dishes, a coffee pot and can opener. <br /><br />A grill, campfire ring, picnic table and bathhouse with a flush toilet and shower are located outside, not far from the cabin. The cabin has an accessible ramp to the front porch, providing wheelchair access to the main floor of the house and one bedroom. The bath house and the path from the house to the bathhouse is not wheelchair accessible. The cabin provides running water from mid-May to mid-October; at other times, users must bring potable water. Due to higher elevation (8,200), the water may be turned off by October 1st , if early season freezing occurs. Please call the Forest Service to confirm potable water availability. The cabin now has a solar lighting system in the main house. The bath house solar system has a five minute motion activated timer, which reactivates by waving your hand under the ceiling motion sensor. Please ensure all lights are turned off upon departure. <br /><br />Guests must bring their own bedding (or sleeping bags) for one double bed, two queen futons and four single beds, as well as flashlights, towels, garbage bags, warm clothes, dish soap, dish towels, an axe or saw for splitting wood, and matches and newspaper for starting fires in the wood stove. Lawn chairs are not provided, but can be toted along for sitting outdoors in the summer months. Be responsible and pick up any pet waste.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearby city of Flagstaff is a popular stop along historic U.S. Route 66 and offers plenty of restaurants, museums, shops and an astronomical observatory.<br /><br />Guests can also drive 58 miles to the Grand Canyon National Parks scenic South Rim.",
