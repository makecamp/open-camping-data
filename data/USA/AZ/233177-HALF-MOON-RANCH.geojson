    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Half Moon Ranch is a ranch style house located in the east Cochise Stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains of Coronado National Forest. The house is situated in a dramatic canyon that provides excellent hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding opportunities. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Half Moon Ranch is surrounded by the rugged beauty of the Cochise Stronghold. Located to the west of Sunsites, Arizona in the Dragoon Mountains at an elevation of 5,000 feet, this sparsely wooded area is a protective rampart of granite spires, sheer cliffs, balanced rocks and boulders which were once the refuge of  Apache Chief, Cochise.<br /><br />The ranch house lies in a mountain range or &quot;sky island&quot; in the Coronado National Forest, rising dramatically from the desert floor, supporting abundant and biologically diverse plant and animal communities. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Rock climbing is long standing in the area, boasting backcountry and protected routes ranging from one to seven pitches in length, and from 5.6 to 5.12 in difficulty. Most approaches are 30-60 minutes in length, although there are a number of known areas that are easily accessible from the roads.<br /><br />Birders congregate in southeastern Arizona as it is touted as one of the countrys most revered birding areas. With 15 species of hummingbirds, 36 species of wood warblers, and over 256 documented bird species, the area is a birders paradise.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Half Moon Ranch is a seven-room ranch style house, suitable for groups of up to 10 people. The house has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a living room, a dining room and a  kitchen. The master bedroom has a queen-size bed and the second bedroom has both a bunk bed and a single bed.
