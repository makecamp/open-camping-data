    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Horse Thief Cabin is situated in a clearing of Ponderosa pines at an elevation of over 6,000 feet in the Bradshaw Mountains of the Prescott National Forest. <br />The original cabin was built in 1939 as quarters and a staging area for Forest Service crews charged with protecting the southern end of the Bradshaw Mountains against wildfires. The cabin was remodeled and modernized over the years, but eventually fell into disuse by the 1980s. <br />The historic structure now enjoys a second life as a rental cabin, providing a unique recreation opportunity for visitors to the Prescott National Forest.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The nearby Castle Creek Wilderness is defined by rugged and diverse terrain ranging from lower elevations with saguaro cactus, palo verde, mesquite, jojoba, cat claw, and grasslands to higher elevations dominated by pi&ntilde;on pine and juniper. <br />Dense populations of mule deer and javelina inhabit this area, along with a few mountain lions, bobcats, black bears, coyotes, rabbits, foxes, skunks, and badgers. Snakes and lizards live here, and numerous birds soar overhead, including doves, quail, hawks, owls, ravens, jays, and many smaller species. <br />The area is rich in history, including early Native American inhabitants and later in the 1860s, home to horse thieves and rustled livestock. Evidence of historical mining activity abounds in this area, especially in the nearby community of Crown King.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Anglers will appreciate the short hike from the cabin to Horse Thief Basin Lake, stocked with largemouth bass, channel catfish and sunfish. Non-motorized boating is also available at the lake.<br />Hikers will have plenty of opportunities to explore the area on trails leading to Horse Thief Canyon, Twin Peaks, Castle Creek and Jim Creek.<br />Off-highway vehicles have several roads and trails available for travel, and a lookout tower and a campground are in close proximity.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin can accommodate up to six people and is furnished with four beds, including, two twin beds, one queen bed, and one double futon. The cabin is equipped with running water, electricity, propane heater, and fans for cooling. <br />The kitchen has all the basic amenities including a sink, propane stove/oven, refrigerator, toaster, coffee maker, and table with six chairs. The bathroom has a flush toilet, sink, and shower. There are grills and a picnic table on site. <br />Although the cabin has several amenities, guests must also provide a few of their own supplies, including food, sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, and garbage bags. The Homeland Security recommends a well prepared Emergency Kit for any emergency.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Horse Thief Lookout Tower as well as Hazlett Hollow and Turney Gulch Campgrounds are in close proximity to the cabin.",
