    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Rock Bluff Group Site is just a short distance from Parker Canyon Lake in a remote and scenic region of the Coronado National Forest in southeastern Arizona. The site is open to groups of up to 50 people to enjoy camping and picnicking, as well as fishing and boating at the lake.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The group camping area sits at an elevation of 5,400 feet in a small, rocky canyon dotted with oaks and junipers. Animals unique to the southwest, such as coatimundi, javelina and roadrunners, occasionally make appearances around the lake.<br><br>The Coronado National Forest covers 1.78 million acres of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Elevations range from 3,000 to 10,720 feet in 12 widely scattered mountain ranges, or sky islands, that rise dramatically from the desert floor, supporting biologically diverse plant communities.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Campers can enjoy an interpretive trail around the lake that begins a quarter-mile walk from Rock Bluff. Trailside benches are located at some of the best wildlife viewing areas. Bald eagles are regularly sighted during the winter, and osprey are sometimes seen migrating through the area in the fall.<br><br>For those who like to fish, Parker Canyon Lake offers both cold and warm water species, including stocked rainbow trout and resident bass, sunfish and catfish. Boating is available with a limit of one 10-horsepower motor or less.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The camping area consists of three sites with two tables and two campfire rings each. Tables and grills are clustered on small, walled patios. The facility provides trash collection and toilets.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>A lakeside developed recreation site, including a boat ramp, fishing pier, general store and boat rentals, is located just a short drive from the group area.",
