The lake provides some of the best fishing and boating in Central Texas and the park offers amenities for large groups of up to 80 people, such as flush toilets, showers, a playground, a swim beach and two two-lane boat ramps.<br /><br />Belton Lake was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the construction of Belton Dam in 1954. The 12,300-acre lake is located on the Leon River, just upstream of the confluence of the Leon River and the Little River. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The facility is directly on the shores of Belton lake with mostly open sunny spaces, occasionally dotted with trees.  <br /><br />Deer, turkey and other small game are commonly seen, and a man-made wetland on the opposite side of the lake was constructed to provide an additional 25 acres of wildlife habitat in the lake area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Temples Lake Park is a destination for boaters and anglers. Popular fish species include hybrid striped bass, largemouth bass, white bass, catfish and sunfish. Visitors can also make use of a swimming beach, volleyball and basketball courts and a playground in the facility.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The park has one group shelter called Temples Pavilion that must be reserved.
