    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Longhorn Park Picnic Area overlooks the beautiful Benbrook Lake in north-central Texas. The park is an excellent destination for barbecuing and boating along the lake shore. <br /><br />Fossil hunting is popular around Benbrook. Visitors can search for ancient clams and corral remnants from more than 85 million years ago.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The picnic area is on the highest part of the lake and overlooks the east side of the dam. The lake, in the Grand Prairie region of Texas, sits on the Trinity River on the southwest edge of the Fort Worth metropolitan area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Prevailing southwesterly winds on the lake attract plenty of avid windsurfers to the lake. Fishing, hiking, swimming and boating are popular pastimes. The lake record for largemouth bass is over thirteen pounds. Other catches include carp, sunfish and flathead catfish.<br /><br />Longhorn does not offer direct lake access, but a short walk will take visitors to a swimming area.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The large picnic shelter can accommodate up to 100 guests. A volleyball court and horseshoe pit offer additional recreation opportunities.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Baseball fields, horseback rentals and golf courses are located near the picnic area. <br /><br />The Fort Worth Stockyards National Historic District and the Fort Worth Zoo are also local attractions.",
