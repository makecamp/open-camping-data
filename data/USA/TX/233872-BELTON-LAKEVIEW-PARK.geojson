    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Belton Lakeview Park has two reservable group day-use areas along the lower shore of Belton Lake, providing some of the best fishing and boating in Central Texas. <br /><br />The facility is perched on a bluff overlooking Belton Lake and Dam, a year-round scenic location for group picnics and large gatherings. The site offers many amenities, such as flush toilets, water and electric hookups, a playground and a two-lane boat ramp, ensuring your stay is both comfortable and enjoyable. <br /><br />Belton Lake was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the construction of Belton Dam in 1954. The 12,300-acre lake is located on the Leon River, just upstream of the confluence of the Leon River and the Little River. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The group use areas are along the forested shoreline of Belton Lake; there is plenty of shade provided by trees and picnic shelters. The sites are not directly on the water, but provide a view of the lake. <br /><br />The lake area is a habitat for deer, wild turkey and water birds such as Great Blue herons, ducks, geese, many species of songbirds and even an occasional bald eagle.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Belton Lakeview Park is a great destination for boaters and anglers. Popular fish species include hybrid striped bass, largemouth bass, white bass, catfish and sunfish. Guests can also make use of the playgrounds and nature trails.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The Franks area holds 120 people, and Overlook can accommodate 150 people. They each provide a large pavilion, playground, restrooms and hookups. <br /><br />Overlook is next to Belton Dam and Franks is 1/4 mile west of the dam near the marina. There is no direct lake access from the group areas, but the boat ramp is nearby within the park. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Belton Lake is located adjacent to the Fort Hood Army Base, which has several points of interest for the military buff. The mural painted on the spillway wall of Belton Dam depicts the history of the Bell County area.<br /><br />Miller Springs Nature area, located on the North end of Belton Dam across from Live Oak Ridge park, offers great hiking opportunities.",
