    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Willow Creek Group Campground is located on Lake Granby, six miles north of Granby, in north central Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its great canoeing, kayaking, fishing and hiking opportunities.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The campground is situated on the southern shore of Willow Creek Reservoir, at an elevation of 8,130 feet. Afternoon thunderstorms should be expected during the summer months.<br /><br />Due to the mountain pine beetle infestation and consequent removal of hazardous trees, there is no shade within the campground.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Willow Creek Reservoir is a 300-acre, no-wake lake. It is open to canoes, kayaks and other non-motorized boats. Anglers fish for rainbow, brown and brook trout. Willow Creek can be accessed nearby.
