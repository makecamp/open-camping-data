    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Florida Campground is located near the north end of Lemon Reservoir, in southwestern Colorado. Visitors enjoy the area for its fishing, trail opportunities and scenic natural setting.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>This lightly used campground is situated in a shady forest of Colorado blue spruce, Douglas fir and aspen trees. The swift Florida River flows next to the campground.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The Florida River is well known for its rainbow and brown trout fishing, but the river runs through much private land, so anglers should be careful not to trespass.<br /><br />Hiking and biking are popular activities in the area. The Burnt Timber Trail No. 667 begins at Transfer Park, about a mile north of the campground. <br /><br />The East Florida Road (Forest Road 597) winds steeply uphill past the campground. Lost Lake and Stump Lake Trails begin along this road, offering short, easy hikes to backcountry lakes.<br /><br />The surrounding area is open to public hunting. Deer, elk and small game such as rabbits and grouse inhabit the forest.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The campground offers one group site, equipped with picnic and serving tables, as well as campfire rings with grills. Vault toilets and drinking water are provided.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Lemon Reservoir is about three miles from the campground, offering boating, water skiing and fishing opportunities. The reservoir is stocked with rainbow trout and kokanee salmon. Many visitors take advantage of Colorados Free Fishing Days, held annually the first full weekend of June.<br /><br />Youngs Canyon Trail No. 546 begins at the north end of the reservoir. Hikers must cross the Florida River to access the trail; crossing is tricky during high water. The trail is very popular during hunting season.",
