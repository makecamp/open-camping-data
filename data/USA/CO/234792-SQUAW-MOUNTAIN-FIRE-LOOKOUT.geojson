In addition to being an active communication site, the Squaw Mountain area is a popular dispersed recreation use area with hiking, recreational shooting, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and camping.  The lookout is a unique structure constructed of native granite which is situated at over 11,000 feet elevation and was built in the 1940&rsquo;s by the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The cab measures 14 feet by 14 feet and is completely lined by windows on each side and surrounded by a catwalk, all of which sit on top of a one story stone base.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Besides offering the unique experience of staying in a fire lookout, Squaw Mountain Lookout will provide visitors outstanding panoramic views of the Great Plains, Denver, Mount Evans, Pikes Peak, Longs Peak and other snow-capped peaks.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, wildlife viewing, scenic driving, picnicking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing are all easily accessible while staying at the lookout. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The lookout contains an electric stove, refrigerator, and heat; beds; table and chairs; cookware and dishes; and an exterior incinerating toilet.
