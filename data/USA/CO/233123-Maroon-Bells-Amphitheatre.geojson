    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Reputed to be the most photographed mountains in Colorado, the spectacular Maroon Bells dominate this setting. Hemmed in by Maroon Lake, aspen groves and evergreen forests, Maroon Bells Amphitheatre is designed for interpretive talks, and is especially popular for recreational events and weddings.<br /><br /> The amphitheatre is available for use by the general public and can be reserved for private events. Receptions are not allowed at this location, but can be held at the nearby East Maroon Portal Picnic site. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>The Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness is one of the 5 original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline.<br /><br /> Towering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique in theRockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that gives the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing.<h4>Recreation:</h4>For hikers and backpackers, the Maroon-Snowmass Trail epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Snowmass Creek Trailhead, the trail winds through aspen groves, crosses streams, and switchbacks through forests. Climbing to alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in early summer.<br /><br /> Designated camping sites are located at Crater Lake or Maroon Lake about 6 miles from the trailhead. Check regulations for camping in Colorado wilderness areas.<h4>Facilities:</h4>Designed for interpretive programs, the amphitheatre can be reserved by the general public for private events.
