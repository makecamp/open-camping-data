    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Lake Isabel Cabin is ideal for guests who wish to experience camping in the Pike and San Isabel National Forest, yet sleep in a bed with a roof overhead. The modern cabin is full-service and can accommodate up to six guests, with convenient access to Lake Isabel, just three minutes away.  <br /><br />Lake Isabel is one of the few lakes in Colorado developed purely for recreation. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the lake attracts many campers who come to hike, canoe, fish and spend time bird watching. St. Charles Creek flows near the cabin and offers an extra option for fishing.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits on the uphill portion of a grassy meadow, offering spectacular mountain views and a chance to see abundant wildlife. Shady pine and aspen trees dot the area. Across the road is the 40-acre Lake Isabel, with a beautiful shoreline that meets the base of rocky mountains. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Lake Isabel welcomes non-motorized boating and fishing. Brown and brook trout are stocked in the lake and the St. Charles headwaters also reaps brook trout. <br /><br />Hiking is available on two nearby trails, the Snow Slide Trail and the Cisneros Trail. The 15-mile Cisneros Trail leads to the heart of the Wet Mountains, through forests and open, wildflower speckled valleys. Along the way, the trail connects to St. Charles Trail, which heads to St. Charles Peak. There are also several motorized trails in the area open to motorcycles and ATVs.<br /><br />Winter activities are also offered, with everything from ice fishing to sledding, tubing and cross country skiing. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The one-bedroom hideaway has modern conveniences like hot showers, electricity, a flush toilet, and a washer and dryer. Outside there are picnic tables, a group campfire ring is provided. Furnishings include three sets of bunk beds, an electric stove and lights, and a cozy fireplace. Parking is available for up to four cars. <br /><br />Guests should bring food, towels, spare clothing, sunscreen, and all other general camping gear.(<a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/chippewa/recreation/recarea/?recid=12753&amp;actid=101>Click here for more cabin details.</a>)<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>A nearby lodge provides paddle and rowboat rentals, groceries and a restaurant.
