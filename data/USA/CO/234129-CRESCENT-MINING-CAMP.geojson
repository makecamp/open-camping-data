    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Cabin campers can escape the city - and escape modern day amenities - by staying at the fully rustic, historic Crescent Mining Camp cabins. The cabins offer a true old fashioned taste of life on the mine in the 19th century, with no electricity or running water. Visitors can focus on the sounds of nature and the incredible views of the Rocky Mountains from its creekside location.<br /><br />The mining camp was built in the 1890s during the boom of mining and milling in Clear Creek Canyon. Miners sought mostly gold and silver, and attracted about 50,000 residents in the valley that is now rather remote. <br /><br />The cabins are adjacent to a road heavily used by off-highway vehicles (OHV). Crescent Mining camp is a good location for OHV enthusiasts, but not visitors seeking quiet and solitude <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Crescent Mining Camp is located within the Leadville Ranger District, which is home to the Sawatch Range, the highest mountain range in Colorado. These rugged, glaciated mountains form the crest of the Continental Divide. Mount Elbert, at 14,443 feet, is Colorados highest peak and 1 of 10 &quot;fourteeners&quot; located on the District.<br /><br />At an elevation of approximately 10,000 feet, Crescent Mining Camp sits at the base of Ervin Peak in Clear Creek Canyon. It is on the outskirts of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness in the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains. Clear Creek passes near the cabins and the Clear Creek Reservoir and the Arkansas River Valley are 9 miles east.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Off-road vehicle trails begin at the site of the cabins and hiking trailheads are within a mile. The most popular trails lead into the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness, which boasts nine mountain peaks over 14,000 feet.<h4>Facilities:</h4>There are four cabins at Crescent, but only cabins Numbered 1 and 2 (one and two) are available for reservations. The two cabins are rented together; one cabin sleeps two, the other sleeps four. Visitors must bring furniture such as cots, portable tables and chairs; in addition, tent camping is permitted.<br /><br /> No water, heat, electricity, or trash service is provided. Guests should bring plenty of water. Creek water may be boiled and treated for consumption. Other items to pack include cook stove, bedding, food, lanterns, matches, cooking utensils, dish soap, bring firewood or an axe to collect(dead/down trees only), and a first aid kit. <h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The nearest spot for pay phones and a grocery store is in Buena Vista, about an hours drive.<br /><br />Visitors can head to Clear Creek Reservoir, about 9 miles east, for fishing and boating. Fish species include brook trout, brown trout and tiger muskie. A few miles further is the Arkansas River, in a section where whitewater rafting is popular.",
