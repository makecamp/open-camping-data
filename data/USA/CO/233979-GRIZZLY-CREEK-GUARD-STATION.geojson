The area around the guard station offers a chance to view abundant wildlife and experience a variety of recreational opportunities year-round.<br /><br /> The guard station is accessible by passenger vehicle when there is no snow; however, high clearance vehicles are recommended in the spring and fall.Access to the cabin in winter is only available by snowmobile, cross-country skis or snowshoes. The cabin offers some creature comforts, but guests should be prepared to bring some of their own supplies and gear.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin sits in an open area among grassland and sagebrush, with nearby aspen groves and lodgepole pine forests.<br /><br />The Mount Zirkel Wilderness lies east of the guard station. The wilderness was one of the original areas protected under the 1964 Wilderness Act and has since been expanded twice to its present size of 160,648 acres. The area boasts ecosystems ranging from sagebrush meadows in the lower areas, through pine and spruce/fir forests, to alpine tundra at high elevations.<br /><br />Elk, deer, moose and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin, and cattle frequently pass by the area as well.<h4>Recreation:</h4>In summer, hiking and fishing can be found within the vicinity. Trailheads leading to hiking and horseback riding trails are an easy drive from the guard station. Designated areas for off-road vehicles are also near the cabin.<br /><br /> In winter, the area is blanketed by snow for wintertime play.
