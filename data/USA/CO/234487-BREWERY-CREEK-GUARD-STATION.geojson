    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Brewery Creek Guard Station is situated at an elevation of 9,500 feet in a densely wooded aspen grove overlooking Brewery Creek. The cabin is a few miles south of the Continental Divide on the northern end of the San Luis Valley in the Rio Grande National Forest.<br /><br /> Built in 1935, the two room cabin was originally used by a forest ranger who oversaw the Poncha and Bonanza Districts of what was then called the Cochetopa National Forest.<br /><br />Today the cabin is a comfortable getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south central Colorado.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin offers wonderful views of Antora Peak (13,266 feet) and Windy Point (12,129 feet) towering over the valley. Active beaver dams occupy the nearby creek just below the cabin, where anglers can cast a line into the frigid waters. Elk, deer, and other wildlife are often seen in meadows adjacent to the cabin. <h4>Recreation:</h4>The area offers many opportunities for hiking and off-road vehicle adventures in summer, hunting in the fall, and cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter.<br /><br />Several hiking trails are in close proximity to the cabin, including several leading up to Antora and Antora Meadows. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The cabin is furnished with three bunkbeds (the top is a single bed, the bottom is a fold-out futon couch that sleeps two) and can accommodate up to nine people.<br /><br />The cabin has stove, refrigerator and heater, all powered with propane. The kitchen is equipped with cooking utensils and some pots and pans.  Picnic tables, a fire pit and a outdoor vault toilet are also on site.<br /><br /> The guard station does not have electricity, though water is available from an outside hand pump. Water is also available at the Saguache Field Office/Ranger District year round.<br /><br />Although the cabin has most amenities, guests do need to provide their own food, sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. It is recommended that guests bring an additional light source in case of emergencies.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Brewery Creek Guard Station is located 2 miles from Bonanza, a historical silver mining town that was booming in the 1880s. Today visitors to Bonanza can see old mines, historical buildings, and old time mining equipment as they follow the Bonanza Mines Off-Highway Vehicle Tour. Maps for the Bonanza Off-Highway Vehicle Tour are available at the Saguache Ranger Station.",
