    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>East Maroon Portal Picnic Site sits next to Maroon Creek, offering spectacular views of aspen and evergreen forests. The area is an excellent gathering spot for families, group gatherings and parties.<br /><br /> Reputed to be the most photographed mountains in Colorado, the spectacular Maroon Bells dominate this setting. The picnic area is available for use by the general public, but can be reserved for private events. This is the only site available in the Maroon Bells Scenic Area for wedding receptions.  <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Located in White River National Forest, the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness is one of the five original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act.  Scenery includes aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline.<br /><br /> Towering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountain range. Unlike other mountains in the Rockies composed of granite and limestone, the Maroon Bells are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that give the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is one of the top recreation Forests in the nation.<br /><br />For hikers and backpackers, the Maroon-Snowmass Trail epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Snowmass Creek Trailhead, the trail winds through aspen groves, crosses streams and switchbacks through forests. Climbing to alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in early summer. Designated camping sites are located at Crater Lake or Maroon Lake about 6 miles from the trailhead. Visitors should check regulations for camping in Colorado wilderness areas.<h4>Facilities:</h4>This picnic area is available for use by the general public, but can be reserved for private events for a fee.
