    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Mingus Ranch is a cabin where guests can step back in time and feel like theyre staying on an early 20th century homestead. The cabin was built in 1908 and was operated by the same family for six decades before it became a Forest Service property.<br /><br />In collaboration with the Frontier Pathways Scenic and Historic Byway and the Colorado State Historical Society, the cabin and neighboring barn have been renovated to match their original appearance and filled with period-specific furniture and antiques. Electricity is provided and a horse corral is onsite.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>The cabin is perched in a sprawling meadow at an elevation of 9,400 feet near the base of Round Top Mountain in the heart of the Wet Mountains. Surrounding the meadow are spruce and other mixed conifers. The scenic Greenhorn Mountain is due south.<h4>Recreation:</h4>Hiking, mountain biking, horse riding, off-road vehicle riding, hunting and wildlife viewing are all enjoyable activities here. An extensive network of hiking trails and roads for biking are nearby. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The modest ranch building is an example of a typical high country ranch with two stories. The cabin sleeps six and conveniences include electric heat, an electric stove and minimal electric lighting. A vault toilet, picnic table and campfire ring are located outside, as well as a horse corral. Furnishings consist of a couple bunk beds with pads, a basic wash, table and chairs and some cooking pots and utensils. <br /><br />No drinking water is available so its important to bring plenty. Other items to bring include bedding, food, garbage bags, dish soap, sunscreen and other basic camping gear. There are minimal lights at the facility, so visitors may want to bring additional light sources.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>2 miles west on Highway 165, visitors can find restaurants and an ATM. Westcliffe, 26 miles west, is the nearest town for conveniences like grocery stores.",
