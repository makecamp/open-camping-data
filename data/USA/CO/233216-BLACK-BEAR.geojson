    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Black Bear Cabin at Mesa Lakes offers guests the opportunity to experience an overnight stay in a traditional Forest Service Ranger Station. The original Black Bear Cabin was constructed in the 1930s, where rangers worked for years overseeing the expansive forest. <br /><br />The cabin is about a 45-minute drive from Grand Junction area of western Colorado, and plenty of canoeing, mountain biking and fishing activities are within reach. From mid-August through October, guests can enjoy fall colors with extensive golden aspen stands surrounding the area. A large grass yard fronts the cabin, which can be used for family gatherings and weddings.This cabin is not ADA accessible.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Black Bear is perched on a grassy lawn, partially shaded by large pines. Spruce, fir and aspen are among the surrounding trees. At an elevation of 9,500, the cabin is in close proximity to several mountain lakes, including Waterdog Reservoir and Jumbo Reservoir. Mesa Creek flows nearby. <br /><br />A variety of wildlife, including deer, elk and moose, frequents the area.<h4>Recreation:</h4>A popular mountain biking and horseback riding trail, West Bench Trail #501, connects the seven lakes of the Mesa Lakes Recreation Area. The cabin is also within walking distance to a carry-down boat ramp for canoeing and kayaking.<br /><br />The Grand Mesa Scenic Byway is well worth exploring. The byway passes near the cabin and offers 63 miles of scenery as it climbs from the rugged canyon floor up to the forested mesa tops at 11,000 feet.
