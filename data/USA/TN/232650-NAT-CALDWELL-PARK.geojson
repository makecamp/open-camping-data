    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Nat Caldwell Park, located on the shores of Old Hickory Lake, is just a short drive from Nashville, Tennessee. The park is an ideal place for a day of picnicking and boating with a convenient boat ramp for easy lake access and group picnic shelter for entertaining. <h4>Natural Features:</h4>Old Hickory Lake is a 22,500 acre reservoir created by the Old Hickory Lock and Dam on the Cumberland River.  The lake is named after former president Andrew Jackson, a Tennessee-native nicknamed &quot;Old Hickory&quot; for his tough and aggressive personality. <br /><br />The lake features 440 miles of scenic shoreline, surrounded by wooded flatlands and plenty of access points. <h4>Recreation:</h4>Nat Caldwell is quieter than some of its neighboring picnic areas, making it a wonderful place to fish, view wildlife or simply get away from it all.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The group picnic shelter holds 50 guests and the parking area fits 45 vehicles. Facilities include flush toilets and a boat ramp.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Hikers can explore the 1.1-mile Old Hickory Lake Nature Trail with three loops that range in terrain: the Woodland Loop, Willow Swamp Loop and the Wildlife Loop. <br /><br />The lake is also near The Hermitage, a National Historic Landmark and plantation where former president, Andrew Jackson lived in the early 19th century.",
