    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>Old Hickory Beach sits along the lengthy shoreline of Old Hickory Lake. The day-use area is perfect for visitors looking to spend a day on the lake or lounging on the beach. Entertaining is easy with a large group picnic shelter  accommodating up to 100 guests and grills for cooking out. <br /><br />Birders can find a mix of waterfowl, wading birds, migratory songbirds and the occasional Blue heron or Snowy egret.  Other wildlife in the area includes wild turkey, rabbits and white-tailed deer.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Old Hickory Lake is a 22,500 acre reservoir created by the Old Hickory Lock and Dam on the Cumberland River.  The lake is named after former president Andrew Jackson, a Tennessee-native nicknamed &quot;Old Hickory&quot; for his tough and aggressive personality. <br /><br /><h4>Recreation:</h4>Swimming and sailing are popular activities on the lake, while anglers will find an abundant population of catfish, crappie and bass for exceptional bank and boat fishing. <br /><br />Hikers can explore the 1.1-mile Old Hickory Lake Nature Trail, featuring three loops (the Woodland Loop, Willow Swamp Loop and the Wildlife Loop), covering varying terrain. <h4>Facilities:</h4>The Old Hickory shoreline offers a sandy swimming beach, a playground for the kids and a boat ramp.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Take in the nightlife of downtown Nashville if city entertainment beckons. Or stick with the great outdoors and sit on the fishing piers at Rockland, Sanders Ferry, Shutes Branch, and Bledsoe Creek State Park. The lake is also near the Hermitage, the plantation where U.S. President Andrew Jackson lived in the early 1800s.",
