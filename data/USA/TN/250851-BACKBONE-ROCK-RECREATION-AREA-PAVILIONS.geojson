    "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>The pavilions at Backbone Rock Recreation Area are popular locations for family reunions, weddings and other types of group gatherings. The two pavilions are in distinctly separate areas. Pavilion #1 is larger and adjacent to a large field, Beaverdam Creek and large parking area. Pavilion #2 is in a more secluded setting down old stone steps and along Beaverdam Creek.<h4>Natural Features:</h4><b>Backbone Rock Recreation Area is located along Beaverdam Creek in northern Johnson County.  Backbone Rock gets its name from a spur ridge on Holston Mountain that ends abruptly at a bend in Beaverdam Creek.  A tunnel was drilled through the rock in 1901 to allow railroad access between Shady Valley and Damascus, VA.  Motorists pass through what is locally known as &quot;The shortest tunnel in the world&quot; as they travel along TN 133.</b><h4>Recreation:</h4>There is a trail that will take you to the top of Backbone Rock, following a stone-step wooded path. The trail crosses the rock and leads to Beaverdam Creek or Backbone Rock Falls. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail adjoins Backbone Rock Trail. Beaverdam Creek is known for its excellent fishing.<h4>Facilities:</h4>There is a CCC-era pavilion at each site with picnic tables and grills.  The larger pavilion, Pavilion #1, includes a stone fireplace and four large picnic tables with additional tables and grills nearby. Vault toilets are located within the parking area. Pavilion #2 also has an original stone fireplace, four tables and nearby grills and additional tables. Parking and a vault toilet are located across the street from the picnic area.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>Damascus, Virginia is five miles north of Backbone Rock for any in-town needs.",
